1,71,j. bruno j. stachowicz m. bertness,Inclusion of facilitation into ecological theory,2003,"Investigations of the role of competition, predation and abiotic stress in shaping natural communities were a staple for previous generations of ecologists and are still popular themes. However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms. But, ultimately, revising ecological theory will lead to a more accurate and inclusive understanding of natural communities.",data/mutualism.pdf,0

Jensen,Thegfactor: The science of mental ability,1998,"Jensen provides a comprehensive treatment of one of the major constructs of behavioral science—general mental ability—labeled the g factor by its discoverer—C. Spearman. The g factor is about individual differences in mental abilities. In factor analyses of any and every large and diverse collection of measures of mental abilities, however varied the content of knowledge and skills they call upon, g emerges as the largest, most general source of differences between individuals and between certain subpopulations.

5,44,"H. L. J. van der Maas, B. Hopkins",Developmental transitions,1998,"Structural approaches to development, such as Piaget's stage theory, have proved to be problematic in dealing with developmental transitions. More promising in this respect are models of qualitative change that address macroscopical phase shifts in non‐linear dynamical systems that arise from quantitative changes at the microscopical level. In this introductory paper, we attempt to clarify the meanings of some of the core terms used in these models so as to set the scene for the subsequent contributions. We stress the relevance of recent advances in catastrophe theory for detecting developmental transitions and suggest that the concept of self‐organization as formulated in irreversible thermodynamics provides a framework for explaining them. As yet, there is a lack of convincing evidence that transitions of interest to developmental psychologists comply with principles of self‐organization that have become well established for time‐evolving systems in other disciplines such as chemistry and biology. Demonstrations of self‐organization in psychologically relevant simulation models are a first step in attaining such evidence. In this special issue, we concentrate primarily on a common approach to the detection of transitions across a number of domains of development. However, in doing so illustrations are given of the ways in which the hypothesis of self‐organization can be used to account for the mechanisms of developmental transitions.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.studeersnel.nl/nl/document/universiteit-utrecht/culture-and-development/hoofdstuk-5-developmental-transitions/1166266,0

For instance, in the newspaper, we read about the problems of developing countries. At another level, personal development is considered an important issue and people spend considerable effort in promoting their development and that of others for whom they have responsibility. The notion of development has subtle and diverse meanings, which are reasonably adequately covered by everyday language. Scientific discourse about development as such, apart from the technical aspects of applying it to one or other specific domain of inquiry, is not much better developed, if at all, than its everyday counterpart. It might be interesting, therefore, to look at the intuitive meaning of the notion of development, in an attempt to uncover aspects that might be worth considering in more formal, scientific approaches.

7,91,"Ackerman, P. L., & Lohman, D. F.",Education and g,2003,"This chapter highlights the central conceptual issues associated with evaluating the relationship between education and intelligence. The notion that intelligence influences educational success has been taken as a given among most theorists and researchers over the past century. The corpus of data suggests that both propositions are likely to be true to one degree or another, especially in terms of IQ test scores. The verisimilitude of these propositions, though, is most clearly demonstrated at the margins. Thus, individuals with very low measured intelligence are most highly likely to fail in mainstream educational assignments. Similarly, the complete absence of schooling appears highly likely to lead to very low measured intelligence. In between, the effects of intelligence on educational success and the effects of schooling on intelligence become attenuated. It is clear, however, that measured intelligence is not fixed and constant. It appears that the effects of education on intelligence tend to be more marked with younger children than with adults. The factors that influence change in intelligence may be general, or they may be multifaceted, such as involving constellations of traits that are mutually supportive or impeding for intellectual development.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://hackscience.education/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ackerman_CV_202205.pdf,0

The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system.

15,81,L. S. Gottfredson,The general intelligence factor,1998,"No subject in psychology has pro- voked more intense public controversy than the study of human intelligence. From its beginning, research on how and why people differ in overall mental ability has fallen prey to political and social agendas that obscure or distort even the most well-established scientific findings. Journalists, too, often present a view of intelligence research that is exactly the opposite of what most intel- ligence experts believe. For these and other reasons, public understanding of intelligence falls far short of public con- cern about it. The IQ experts discussing their work in the public arena can feel as though they have fallen down the rabbit hole into Alice’s Wonderland. The debate over intelligence and intelligence testing focuses on the ques- tion of whether it is useful or meaning- ful to evaluate people according to a single major dimension of cognitive competence. Is there indeed a general mental ability we commonly call “intel- ligence,” and is it important in the prac- tical affairs of life? The answer, based on decades of intelligence research, is an unequivocal yes. No matter their form or content, tests of mental skills invari- ably point to the existence of a global factor that permeates all aspects of cog- nition. And this factor seems to have considerable influence on a person’s practical quality of life. Intelligence as measured by IQ tests is the single most effective predictor known of individual performance at school and on the job. It also predicts many other aspects of well- being, including a person’s chances of divorcing, dropping out of high school, being unemployed or having illegitimate children. By now the vast majority of intelli- gence researchers take these findings for granted. Yet in the press and in public debate, the facts are typically dismissed, downplayed or ignored. This misrepresen- tation reflects a clash between a deeply felt ideal and a stubborn reality. The ideal, implicit in many popular critiques of intelligence research, is that all people are born equally able and that social inequali- ty results only from the exercise of unjust privilege. The reality is that Mother Nature is no egalitarian. People are in fact unequal in intellectual potential—and they are born that way, just as they are born with different potentials for height, physical attractiveness, artistic flair, ath- letic prowess and other traits. Although subsequent experience shapes this poten- tial, no amount of social engineering can make individuals with widely divergent mental aptitudes into intellectual equals. Of course, there are many kinds of talent, many kinds of mental ability and many other aspects of personality and character that influence a person’s chances of happiness and success. The functional importance of general mental ability in everyday life, however, means that without onerous restrictions on individual liberty, differences in mental competence are likely to result in social inequality. This gulf between equal opportunity and equal outcomes is per- haps what pains Americans most about the subject of intelligence. The public intuitively knows what is at stake: when asked to rank personal qualities in order of desirability, people put intelligence second only to good health. But with a more realistic approach to the intellectual differences between people, society could better accommodate these differences and minimize the inequalities they create. Extracting g Early in the century-old study of intelligence, researchers discovered that all tests of mental ability ranked individ- uals in about the same way. Although mental tests are often designed to mea- sure specific domains of cognition—ver- bal fluency, say, or mathematical skill, spatial visualization or memory—people who do well on one kind of test tend to do well on the others, and people who do poorly generally do so across the board. This overlap, or intercorrelation, suggests that all such tests measure some global element of intellectual abil- ity as well as specific cognitive skills. In recent decades, psychologists have devoted much effort to isolating that general factor, which is abbreviated g, from the other aspects of cognitive abili- ty gauged in mental tests. The statistical extraction of g is per- formed by a technique called factor analysis. Introduced at the turn of the century by British psychologist Charles Spearman, factor analysis determines the minimum number of underlying dimen- sions necessary to explain a pattern of correlations among measurements. A general factor suffusing all tests is not, as is sometimes argued, a necessary out- come of factor analysis. No general factor has been found in the analysis of per- sonality tests, for example; instead the method usually yields at least five dimen- sions (neuroticism, extraversion, consci- entiousness, agreeableness and openness to ideas), each relating to different sub- sets of tests. But, as Spearman observed, a general factor does emerge from analy- sis of mental ability tests, and leading psychologists, such as Arthur R. Jensen of the University of California at Berkeley and John B. Carroll of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have con- firmed his findings in the decades since. Partly because of this research, most intel- ligence experts now use g as the working definition of intelligence. The general factor explains most differences among individuals in perfor- mance on diverse mental tests.

19,73,j. carroll,The Three-Stratum Theory of Cognitive Abilities.,1997,"The three-stratum theory is a theory of cognitive ability proposed by the American psychologist John Carroll in 1993.[1][2] It is based on a factor-analytic study of the correlation of individual-difference variables from data such as psychological tests, school marks and competence ratings from more than 460 datasets. These analyses suggested a three-layered model where each layer accounts for the variations in the correlations within the previous layer.  The three layers (strata) are defined as representing narrow, broad, and general cognitive ability. The factors describe stable and observable differences among individuals in the performance of tasks. Carroll argues further that they are not mere artifacts of a mathematical process, but likely reflect physiological factors explaining differences in ability (e.g., nerve firing rates). This does not alter the effectiveness of factor scores in accounting for behavioral differences.  Carroll proposes a taxonomic dimension in the distinction between level factors and speed factors. The tasks that contribute to the identification of level factors can be sorted by difficulty and individuals differentiated by whether they have acquired the skill to perform the tasks. Tasks that contribute to speed factors are distinguished by the relative speed with which individuals can complete them. Carroll suggests that the distinction between level and speed factors may be the broadest taxonomy of cognitive tasks that can be offered. Carroll distinguishes his hierarchical approach from taxonomic approaches such as Guilford's Structure of Intellect model (three-dimensional model with contents, operations, and products).",data/mutualism.pdf,0

21,70,h. eysenck,Thomson's 'bonds' or Spearman's 'energy': sixty years on,1987,"The author examines the relative merits of the Binet-Thomson-Guilford theories of intelligence and Spearman's theory of intelligence as"" enerp""'This latter was compatible with Galton's concept of general intelligence as a primarily biological and genetically transmissable reality. Almost from the beginning of the scientific study of human intelligence, there has been an interesting bifurcation, identified with the names and views of Sir Francis Galton and Alfred Binet (Eysenck, 1985, 1986). For Galton, general intelligence was a meaningful concept, based on biological reality, whereas for Binet it was a statistical artefact, nothing more than the average of a number of semi-independent faculties. Galton stressed the genetic side, Binet the educational and environ-mental. Last but not least, Galton looked for physiological methods of measurement, instancing reaction time among others, whereas Binet used tasks involving problem solving, learning, memory, etc. As has been well documented (Eysenck, 1979; Vernon, 1979), Binet's methods of measurement were almost universally adopted, and his general views were very widely accepted, particularly in the United States; psychologists in the United Kingdom were more sympathetic to Galton-type ideas. In recent years, there has been a revolution in this field, based on experimental studies of reaction time and evoked potentials as measures of intelligence (Eysenck, 1983), and these studies may cause a reappraisal of the whole situation (Eysenck & Barrett, 1985). A new"" model for intelligence""(Eysenck, 1982) seems likely to emerge from these upheavals. In this paper an attempt will be made to assess to which extent these recent findings are relevant to another theoretical bifurcation, not unrelated to that mentioned above, namely that between the Thorndike-Thomson theory of bonds (Thorn-dike, Bregman, and Cobb, 1927; Thomson, 1951), and Spear-man's theory of"" energy""(Spearman, 1927). These two causal theories were put forward in an attempt to explain certain agreed observations in the psychometric field, namely that correlations between cognitive tests were almost universally positive ("" positive manifold""), and the resulting matrices tend-ed to have a low rank, possibly rank one. Spearman argued that THE MANKIND QUARTERLY these facts supported his theory of a general factor of intelli-gence ("" g""), whereas Thomson put forward an alternative view which argued that the mind had little structure and that similar psychometric effects would be manifested if"" we have a causal background comprising innumerable bonds, and if any measure-ments we make can be influenced by any sample of that back-ground, one measurement by this sample and another by that, all samples being possible; and if we choose a number of dif-ferent measurements and find their intercorrelations, the matrix of these intercorrelations will tend to be hierarchical, or at least tend to have a low reduced rank""(Thomson, 1951: p. 271). As he also points out, this is nothing to do with the mind: it is simply a mathematical necessity, whatever the material used to illustrate it. These two alternative views had their origin already much earlier (Spearman, 1904; Thomson, 1916, 1919, 1927, 1935), and they attracted much attention. Mathematicians tended to side with Thomson (Bartlett, 1937, McDonald, 1967; Mackie, 1928), and more recently Maxwell (1972), who made an attempt to resurrect Thomson's theory.

26,2,C. Spearman,The abilities of man: Their nature and measurement,1927,"To begin with, a few lines may be useful to mark out the topic which we are going to consider, and to indicate how this fits into the general order of things. A person is aware of himself as existing in the midst of an external world—or at least, so it seems to him. He not only perceives this world and himself, but also thinks about both. As a single word to include the processes of both the perceiving and the thinking, modern psychology employs “ cognition.” But what he thus perceives and thinks about the world and himself, as also about the relations between the two, excites in him activities and states of another kind, such as appetites, aversions, impulses, decisions, voluntary actions, pleasure, sorrow, and so forth. All these, to distinguish them from the cognitive processes, are called “ conative ” and “ affective,” that is to say, striving and feeling. Take as an example the following description from Oliver Twist: “So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?” said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; “ Eh? ” Oliver I 2 THE ABILITIES OF MAN made no reply. But he watched the Jew’s motions, and breathed quickly. ‘ Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?” sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. “ We'll cure you of that, my young master.” The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver’s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room. “I won’t stand by and see it done, Fagin,” cried the girl. ‘You’ve got the boy, and what more would you have? Let him be—let him be—or I shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before my time.” Here is a typical picture of human mental life in one of its most acute phases. Observe how readily and naturally it agrees with the foregoing classification of processes. Fagin sees Oliver, remembers his attempt to escape, thinks of — punishing him, notices his club, marks the boy shrinking away and breathing quickly, perceives him stagger under the blow, hears his agonized whimper, foresees his better obedience in the future, and has the idea of enforcing thelesson with a second blow—all this and suchlike it is that the term “cognition”? has been coined to include. But Fagin also becomes angry at what the boy has done, enter- tains a desire to punish him, relishes the anticipation of his writhing in pain, seizes voluntarily the club and actually uses it—all such processes as these characteristically involve conation and affection. Now, the present volume is primarily concerned with a person’s ability to “ cognise.”” And we must at once demur —it is the chief reason for prefixing this little chapter—to an objection rather in vogue at the present day, which, if admitted, would cut the ground from beneath our feet. This consists in asserting that the processes of cognition cannot possibly be treated apart from those of conation and affection,seeing that all these are but inseparable aspects in the in- THE PROBLEM 3 stincts and behaviour of a single individual, who himself, as the very name implies, is essentially indivisible. To this protest—borrowed from metaphysics—we may reply that certainly an individual cannot be broken up into independent pieces. But no less certainly the various aspects of his behaviour can and must be submitted to separate consideration. Every science whatever, physical no less than psychological, is obliged to dissect its subject- matter, to deal with the different aspects of it in succession, and finally to bring each of these into relation with all the rest. Only by first dividing can the scientist eventually conquer. In general, a person’s total cognitive ability may be re- garded as an instrument or organ at the disposal of any of his conative activities. It is this organ, then, that we are principally about to examine, and with especial reference to its variations of efficiency from one individual to another. The conative activities will only be brought within our scope to the extent that is needful to explain the working of the organ. But even this much will involve treating these activities in a far more fundamental manner than is usual in books on human ability",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.nature.com/articles/120181a0,0

Experiments were confined to testing the sensory discrimination of hearing, sight and touch, using the monochord, a graduated series of colored cards, and a graduated series of weights constructed on Galton's cartridge pattern, respectively, for the three conditioned. Five series of experiments were conducted involving varying number of Ss.

This will provide the opportunity to introduce these types of models in a leisurely fashion. To wit, many details will have to be neglected in this way of presentation, but these will be introduced at appropriate places later on. It is noted that some aspects of this relationship have been addressed in the published literature. MacCallum & Ashby (1986) discuss the relationships between linear systems theory and covariance structure modeling. Perhaps the first paper is due to Priestley & Subba Rao (1975), who rewrite the regression estimator (predictor) of factor scores in a standard factor model as a special instance of the Kalman filter (to be defined shortly) associated with a linear state-space model.

They further argue that differences in average national IQs constitute one important factor, but not the only one, contributing to differences in national wealth and rates of economic growth.  The book has drawn widespread criticism from other academics. Critiques have included questioning of the methodology used, the incompleteness of the data, and the conclusions drawn from the analysis.[2][3] The 2006 book IQ and Global Inequality is a follow-up to IQ and the Wealth of Nations by the same authors.  Outline The book includes the authors' calculation of average IQ scores for 60 countries, based on their analysis of published reports. It reports their observation that national IQ correlates with gross domestic product per capita at 0.82, and with the rate of economic growth from 1950 to 1990 at 0.64.  The authors believe that average IQ differences between nations are due to both genetic and environmental factors. They also believe that low GDP can cause low IQ, just as low IQ can cause low GDP. (See Positive feedback).

Here we show that if the interactions between species are allowed to evolve within a generalized Lotka-Volterra model such stabilizing feedbacks and weak interactions emerge automatically. Moreover, we show that trophic levels also emerge spontaneously from the evolutionary approach, and the efficiency of the unperturbed ecosystem increases with time.

Simulation studies of twin pairs using simple non-linear development models characterised by chaotic or near-chaotic behavior are presented. The effect of chaotic processes on correlations is to lower them from their initial values, but high initial correlations are affected much less by chaotic and near-chaotic processes than intermediate correlations. Therefore, we would predict that traits affected by chaotic processes would have high MZ and low DZ twin correlations and this is reminiscent of certain traits such as EEG spectra.

When a genuine stage transition is present, these criteria are expected to be satisfied. A revised catastrophe model accommodating these criteria is proposed for the stage transition in cognitive development from the preoperational to the concrete operational stage.",data/mutualism.pdf,862

However, it is then observed that if people differed in neural plasticity, or the ability to adapt their connections to the environment, then those highly developed in one intellectual ability would be highly developed in other intellectual abilities as well. Simulations are then used to confirm that such a pattern would be obtained. Such a model is also shown to account for many other findings in the field of intelligence that are currently unexplained.

A prominent example is the well-replicated association between inspection time (IT), a measure of perceptual discrimination speed, and intelligence (IQ), where it is not known whether increased speed is a cause or consequence of high IQ. We investigated the direction of causation between IT and IQ in 2012 genetically related subjects from Australia and The Netherlands. Models in which the reliable variance of each observed variable was specified as a latent trait showed IT correlations of -0.44 and -0.33 with respective Performance and Verbal IQ; heritabilities were 57% (IT), 83% (PIQ) and 77% (VIQ). Directional causation models provided poor fits to the data, with covariation best explained by pleiotropic genes (influencing variation in both IT and IQ).

SLODR has been demonstrated in a number of intellectual batteries but several important aspects of the phenomenon are not yet well understood. We investigated the presence of SLODR in the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children—Second Edition (KABC-II), a popular measure of intelligence for children. We used confirmatory factor analysis to investigate the invariance of two hierarchical factor structures across ability groups; the subtest variance explained by the ability factors across groups; and whether SLODR was produced only by subtests with low loadings on the general ability factor. We found that SLODR was present in the KABC-II, and its presence was not dependent on the hierarchical model of intelligence. Moreover, our findings suggest that SLODR acts on g and not on the broad abilities, although the contribution of g to various broad abilities is lower in the high ability group.

A concern about this information—what appears to be wrong with it—is discussed, and the authors offer ideas about what is needed to fill in information that is more nearly correct. It is argued that the major thrust in research aimed at understanding the nature of human intelligence should be directed at understanding capabilities that emerge in adulthood. The principal argument of this chapter is in support for the concept that the quintessence of human intelligence is found in expressions of expertise. Evidence is reviewed on which extended Gf–Gc theory is based. Hypotheses specifying that working memory, depth of processing, consolidation, and chunking as essential processes of intelligence are examined. Research on the development of expertise is reviewed.

It is written for students and researchers with limited mathematical and statistical training who need to use structural equation models to analyze their data, and for those who have tried but failed to learn the LISREL command language. It is not a textbook on factor analysis, structural equations or latent variable models, although there are many examples of such in the book. Rather, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the basic ideas and principles of these types of analyses and techniques. The main objective is to demonstrate that structural equation modelling can be done easily without the technical jargon with which it has been associated. The SIMPLIS language shifts the focus away from the technical question ""How to do it"", so that researchers can concentrate on the question, ""What does it all mean?"" Although the SIMPLIS language makes it easier to specify models and to carry out the analysis, the substantive specification and interpretation remain the same as with the LISREL command language.",data/mutualism.pdf,1119

First, empirical evidence for this daim is reviewed. The evidence from several studies of both first and second languoge acquisition suggests that normal language learning occurs only when exposure to the languoge begins early in life. With exposure beginning later in life, asymptotic performance in the language declines: the effects over oge of first exposure are approximately linear through childhood, with a flattening of the function in adulthood. These outcomes argue that some type of constraints ensuring successful languoge learning exist early in life, and weaken with increasing maturation. Second, two hypotheses are considered as to the nature of these maturational changes. One hypothesis is that constraints on learning particular to languoge acquisition undergo maturational decay. A second hypothesis, which is considered in more detail, suggests that language learning abilities decline because of the expansion of nonlinguisftc cognitive abilities.",data/mutualism.pdf,1119

In the present study, data from the national standardization sample of a French intelligence scale for children aged 4 to 9 years (Echelles Différentielles d'Efficiences Intellectuelles, forme Révisée) were examined to confirm this relationship. Each of the seven subtests of this scale was successively used to divide the sample into two IQ groups (low vs. high IQ) and correlations between the remaining six subtests were computed for each group. Fit measures of matrices revealed that correlations were not statistically different for six of the seven comparisons between low- and high-IQ participants. These results seem to indicate, at least in children aged 4 to 9 years, that lower IQ samples do not manifest a less differentiated pattern of correlations than higher IQ samples. Some theoretical implications of this finding are discussed, notably the need to envisage age as a potentially meaningful variable in research on the law of diminishing returns.",10.1016/J.INTELL.2004.06.002 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000467,1122

Important concepts are the process, level, and rate of growth; minimal structural growth level; carrying capacity and unutilized capacity for growth; and feedback delay. Second, a mathematical model of cognitive growth under limited resources is presented, with the conclusion that the most plausible model is a model of logistic growth with delayed feedback. Third, the model is transformed into a dynamic systems model based on the logistic growth equation. This model describes cognitive growth as a system of supportive and competitive interactions between growers. Models of normal logistic growth, U-shaped growth, bootstrap growth, and competitive growth are also presented. An overview is presented of forms of adaptation of resources (e.g., parental and tutorial assistance and support) to the growth characteristics of a cognitive or linguistic competence.

Indeed, some recent studies suggest that age might moderate the effect of IQ on the differentiation of cognitive abilities. The whole sample (N = 1, 120) was divided into six groups based on age (7–9, 10–12 and 13–15 yr) and on the mean of the subject's standard scores for Vocabulary and Block Design (mean < 10 vs. mean ≥ 10). Correlations between the remaining eleven subtests were then calculated for each group. Results showed an age-related increase in relationships among subtests for low-IQ participants, but good stability for high-IQ participants. This confirms the hypothesis of an Age × IQ interaction on the degree of differentiation of abilities and suggests that persons with low IQ do not exhibit a less differentiated pattern of intellectual abilities from the outset of their development.

Using structural equation modeling, with latent variables, the present study provides the first evidence that this driving force begins in infancy, such that abilities in infancy predict executive functions at age 11. Information processing abilities in three domains (attention, processing speed, and memory) were assessed when participants were infants (7 and 12 months) and toddlers (24 and 36 months) and were used to predict three executive functions (working memory, inhibition, and shifting) when participants were 11 years old. A model relating infant abilities to age-11 executive functions fit well, and accounted for 9% to 19% of the variance in the executive functions. Paths from both speed and memory in infancy to age-11 working memory were significant, as was the path from Speed in infancy to age-11 Shifting.

The increases in temporary storage of speech-based material that take place in the period spanning the pre-school years and adolescence reflect complex changes in many of the different component processes, including perceptual analysis, construction and maintenance of a memory trace, retention of order information, rehearsal, retrieval and redintegration. Another crucial capacity that undergoes a similar striking development is complex working memory, the ability to manipulate and store material simultaneously. Possible sources of age-related changes in working memory include increases in processing efficiency and attentional capacity, and task-switching. These two short-term memory systems might play significant but distinct roles in supporting the acquisition of knowledge and skills during childhood.

This general framework has been instantiated in the ACT system in which facts are encoded in a propositional network and procedures are encoded as productions. Knowledge compilation is the process by which the skill transits from the declarative stage to the procedural stage. It consists of the subprocesses of composition, which collapses sequences of productions into single productions, and proceduralization, which embeds factual knowledge into productions. Once proceduralized, further learning processes operate on the skill to make the productions more selective in their range of applications. These processes include generalization, discrimination, and strengthening of productions. Comparisons are made to similar concepts from past learning theories.

Correlations among tests are about twice as high for low-IQ subjects as for high-IQ subjects. Spearman suggested that this effect be called the “law of diminishing returns”. He thought that smarter people had more “g”. He also reasoned that, as in psychophysical effects, a constant increment would be less discriminable when added to a large base (high-IQ) than to a small base (low-IQ). These differences in discriminability are what caused the correlations to be lower in groups of high-IQ subjects. But Spearman was wrong on two counts. First, any constant added to either or both members of pairs of observations has no effect on the resulting correlation. So size of base could not produce differences in correlation. Second, if g is defined as whatever causes tests to be positively intercorrelated, then low-IQ subjects have more g than high-IQ subjects because their test scores are more highly correlated. Amount of g, as g interpreted by Spearman, represents stupidity, not intelligence.

At 12 years of age, the complete WISC-R was administered (12 subscales). Both intelligence tests resulted in a measure of full-scale IQ (FSIQ). Participation rate is around 93% at age 12.

Genetic analyses show significant heritabilities at all ages, with the expected increase of genetic influences and decrease of shared environmental influences over the years. Genetic influences seem to be the main driving force behind continuity in general cognitive ability, represented by a common factor influencing FSIQ at all ages.

A first battery of cognitive tests was applied to a sample of 3430 participants (mean age=23.12 years). The sample of the Spanish standardization of the WAIS-III was also analyzed (823 participants with a mean age=34.41 years). The methodology of Deary et al.

These results support the differentiation of intelligence across the range of ability. However, a sample effect is observed: WAIS-III results are more supportive of the differentiation theory.

Instances of the general differentiation hypothesis that have been considered in the literature include age and ability differentiation. Traditionally, the differentiation effect is attributed to the varying role of g in the subtest scores of an IQ test with the age or ability variable. We argue that this is only one possible way in which a differentiation effect may arise. We discuss five ways in which differentiation can emerge in the higher-order factor model of intelligence, and demonstrate that these can be tested using moderated factor analysis. Using this method, we study the degree in which the various formal conceptualizations of differentiation can be distinguished statistically. We investigate the age and ability differentiation hypotheses in a real data set using both a traditional method and the method of moderated factor analysis.

Together, they accounted for 36% of the variance. Loadings for all three factors closely resembled those from the 7-month solution, and individuals showed cross-age stability on factor scores, r=0.24-0.51.

When children are separated from their biological mothers shortly after birth and placed nonselectively in adoptive homes, adoptive-parent/adopted-child resemblance can be ascribed to cultural transmission, whereas biological-parent/adopted-child similarities are due to heritable factors. Furthermore, a longitudinal adoption study facilitates examination of changes in these two main sources of variation during development.

Two different cutoff points were used to illustrate the effect of difference in standard deviation (S.D.) for subtest and total ability score. For both samples and for both cutoff points, SLODR could not be confirmed.

There is evidence that nouns but not verbs can be acquired by pairing each sound (e.g., ‘elephant’) with a concept inferred from the world circumstances in which that sound occurs. Verb meanings pose problems for this word-world mapping procedure, motivating a model of verb mapping mediated by attention to the syntactic structures in which verbs occur (Landau and Gleitman 1985, Gleitman 1990). We present an experiment examining the interaction between a conceptual influence (the bias to interpret observed situations as involving a casual agent) and syntactic influences, as these jointly contribute to children's conjectures about new verb meanings. Children were shown scenes ambiguous as to two interpretations (e.g., giving and getting or chasing and fleeing) and were asked to guess the meaning of novel verbs used to described the scenes, presented in varying syntactic contexts. Both conceptual and syntactic constraints influenced children's responses, but syntactic information largely overwhelmed the conceptual bias.

Yet, one cannot always be sure that the test items measure the same constructs in the groups under study. In the present work, 460 participants with intellectual disability of undifferentiated etiology and 488 typical children were tested using Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Data were analyzed using binomial logistic regression modeling designed to detect differential item functioning (DIF). Results showed that 12 items out of 36 function differentially between the two groups, but only 2 items exhibit at least moderate DIF. Thus, a very large majority of the items have identical discriminative power and difficulty levels across the two groups. It is concluded that RCPM can be used with confidence in studies comparing participants with and without intellectual disability. In addition, it is suggested that methods for investigating internal bias of tests used in cross-cultural, cross-linguistic or cross-gender comparisons should also be regularly employed in studies of clinical populations, particularly in the field of developmental disability, to show the absence of systematic measurement error (i.e. DIF) affecting item responses.",10.1016/J.INTELL.2011.04.002 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000547,1286

Jensen has investigated this hypothesis by correlating differences in means and tests' g loadings. The aim of the present article is to investigate B-W differences using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. The advantages of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis over Jensen's test of Spearman's hypothesis are discussed. A published data set is analyzed. Strict factorial invariance is tested and judged to be tenable. Various models are tested, which do and do not incorporate g. It is observed that it is difficult to distinguish between several hypotheses, including and excluding g, concerning group differences.

It is noted that some of the models include a general intellectual factor (g) while others do not. It is also noted that some models are nonhierarchical, while in others more narrow abilities are subsumed under broader abilities in a hierarchical pattern. An empirical study in which a test battery of 16 tests was administered to some 1000 subjects in the 6th grade is reported. Using the LISREL technique to test different models, good support is obtained for oblique primary factors in the Thurstone tradition as well as for the second-order factors fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and general visualization hypothesized by Cattell and Horn. It is also found, however, that the second-order factor of fluid intelligence i is identical with a third-order g-factor. On the basis of these results a three-level model (the HILI-model) is suggested, with the g-factor at the top, two broad factors reflecting the ability to deal with verbal and figural information, respectively, at the second-order level, and the primary factors in the Thurstone and Guilford tradition at the lowest level.

Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual, and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action, unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular, they show how by processes of exploration and selection, multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing perception-action categories. Thelen and Smith offer a radical alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic issues in early cognitive development. The book is divided into three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.

This was investigated in simulated correlation matrices, in which the true g was known exactly, and in typical empirical data consisting of a large battery of diverse mental tests. Theoretically, some methods are more appropriate than others for extracting g, but in fact g is remarkably robust and almost invariant across different methods of analysis, both in agreement between the estimated g and the true g in simulated data and in similarity among the g factors extracted from empirical data by different methods. Although the near-uniformity of g obtained by different methods would seem to indicate that, practically speaking, there is little basis for choosing or rejecting any particular method, certain factor models qua models may accord better than others with theoretical considerations about the nature of g. What seems to us a reasonable strategy for estimating g, given an appropriate correlation matrix, is suggested for consideration. It seems safe to conclude that, in the domain of mental abilities, g is not in the least chimerical. Almost any g is a “good” g and is certainly better than no g.",10.1016/0160-2896(94)90029-9 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160289694900299,1358

It reports the first large experimental inquiry, carried out by the methods of factor analysis described by Thurstone in The Vectors of the Mind 1. The work was made possible by financial grants from the Social Science Research Committee of the University of Chicago, the American Council of Education, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. The results are eminently worthy of the assistance so generously accorded. Thurstone’s previous theoretical account, lucid and comprehensive as it is, is intelligible only to those who have a knowledge of matrix algebra. Hence his methods have become known to British educationists chiefly from the monograph published by W. P. Alexander8. This enquiry has provoked a good deal of criticism, particularly from Professor Spearman’s school ; and differs, as a matter of fact, from Thurstone’s later expositions. Hence it is of the greatest value to have a full and simple illustration of his methods, based on a concrete inquiry, from Professor Thurstone himself.

If you agree with Boring (1923) that intelligence is what the intelligence tests measure, then the science of intelligence is one hundred years old. The author will call this psychometrically defined intelligence. Empirically the study of psychometric intelligence is a booming field, for it has led to a very large literature, impressive technological developments, and coherent relationships among test scores (Carroll, 1993). However, it has a weakness. A purely psychometric approach to intelligence lets the technology of measurement define the concept, rather than the concept defining an appropriate measurement technology. Along with many others, the author prefers a more conceptual, less boring approach. The publication of this volume provides an opportunity to look back at what has been done and, with somewhat more hesitation, to attempt to identify what more needs to be done. Like any large intellectual movement, the study of information processing and intelligence has split into several subareas. The most important ones are reviewed in individual chapters in the current volume. The author will try to take a larger view. To understand our present progress and future challenges, we first need to see how cognitive and differential psychology look today.

Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion, is supported by both theory and experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the establishment (number of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced. These results suggest that local biodiversity represents an important line of defence against the spread of invaders.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12050662/,1413

This method consists of first extracting a general intelligence factor by means of exploratory factor analysis. Secondly, similarity of factor loadings across groups is evaluated in an attempt to ensure that the same constructs are measured. Finally, the correlation is computed between the loadings of the tests on the general intelligence factor and the mean differences between groups on the tests. This part is referred to as a test of ""Spearman's Hypothesis"", which essentially states that differences in g account for the main part of differences in observed scores. Based on the correlation, inferences are made with respect to group differences in general intelligence. The validity of these inferences is investigated and compared to the validity of inferences based on multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. For this comparison, population covariance matrices are constructed which incorporate violations of the central assumption underlying Jensen's method concerning the existence of g and/or violations of Spearman's Hypothesis. It is demonstrated that Jensen's method is quite insensitive to the violations. This lack of specificity is observed consistently for all types of violations introduced in the present study. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis emerges as clearly superior to Jensen's method.",data/mutualism.pdf,1414

The idea that some of us are simply smarter than others touches a raw nerve in a society that tries to combine an Athenian commitment to democracy with a capitalist commitment to reward according to product. What happens when we are confronted with evidence that socially important talents are not distributed equally over society, and even more frighteningly, that there are powerful biological forces working to continue the differential distribution of ability across generations? This argument was made in 1869 by Francis Galton in his work Hereditary Genius,1 and again more than one-hundred years later by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray in The Bell Curve 2 The intervening years have witnessed a great deal of point and counterpoint on the issue, battles fought with more than the normal academic bickering because they expose the conflict between our ideal of a democratic society of equals and the practice of rewarding the best individual effort.

(2) The size of the predictive correlation is essentially the same for habituation and for recognition memory paradigms. (3) This prediction phenomenon is not obviously associated solely with one laboratory, one particular infant response measure, or a few extremely disordered infants. (4) The level of prediction to childhood IQ is substantial given the reliability of the infant measures. (5) Predictions are somewhat higher for risk than for nonrisk samples. (6) Predictions are consistently higher than for standardized infant tests of general development for nonrisk but not for risk samples, and they are not consistently higher than predicting from parental education and socioeconomic status or a few other infant behaviours for nonrisk samples.

Although disrupting disturbances seem an obvious explanation for such shifts, evidence for large disturbances is not always apparent. Here we show that complex communities tend to move through occasional catastrophic shifts in response to gradual environmental change or evolution. This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspecific competition is allowed to exceed intraspecific competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat. These results suggest that alternative attractors may commonly arise from interactions between large numbers of species. Consequently, the response of complex communities to environmental change is expected to be characterized by hysteresis and sudden shifts. Some unexplained regime shifts observed in ecosystems could be related to alternative attractors arising from complex species interactions. Additionally, our results support the idea that ancient mass extinctions may partly be due to an intrinsic loss of stability of species configurations.",data/mutualism.pdf,1420

More promising in this respect are models of qualitative change that address macroscopical phase shifts in non-linear dynamicalsystems that arise from quantitative changes at the microscopical level. In this introductory paper, we attempt to clarify the meanings of some of the core terms used in these models so as to set the scene for the subsequent contributions. We stress the relevance of recent advances in catastrophe theory for detecting developmental transitions and suggest that the concept of self-organisation as formulated in irreversible thermodynamics provides a framework for explaining them. As yet, there is a lack of convincing evidence that transitions of interest to developmental psychologists comply with principles of self-organisation that have become well-established for time-evolving systems in other disciplines such as chemistry and biology. Demonstrations of self-organisation in psychologically-relevant simulation models are a first step in attaining such evidence. In this special issue, we concentrate primarily on a common approach to the detection of transitions across a number of domains of development.However, in doing so illustrations are given of the ways in which the hypothesis of selforganisation can be used to account for the mechanisms of developmental transitions.",data/mutualism.pdf,1456
136,145,boris krupa,On the number of experiments required to find the causal structure of complex systems.,2002,"The need to capture the complexity of biological systems in a simpler formalism is the underlying impetus of biological sciences. Understanding the function of many biological complex systems, such as genetic networks or molecular signalling pathways, requires precise identification of the interactions between their individual components. A number of questions in the study of complex systems are then important-in particular, what can be inferred about the interactions in a complex system from an arbitrary set of experiments, and, what is the minimum number of experiments required to characterize the system? This paper shows that the problem of finding the minimal causal structure of a system based on a set of observations is computationally intractable for even moderately sized systems (it is NP-hard), but a reasonable approximation can be found in a relatively short (polynomial) time. Next, it is shown that the number of experiments required to characterize a complex system grows exponentially with the upper bound on the number of immediate upstream influences of each element, but only logarithmically with the number of elements in the system. This makes it possible to study biological systems with extremely large number of interacting elements and relatively sparse interconnections, such as gene regulatory and cell signalling networks. Finally, the construction of a randomized experimental sequence which achieves this bound is discussed.",data/mutualism.pdf,1463

Psychological opinion in the past has tended to favor discontinuity theories of cognitive development from infancy. In recent years, however, the foundations on which discontinuity positions were originally established have themselves come under question and new findings grounded in new assessment procedures have appeared, necessitating revision of opinion on this significant psychological and developmental issue. Our essay has several aims. We first review briefly the bases for contemporary discontinuity theories of mental development. Second, we present current findings that support the alternative proposition of continuity: Recent research demonstrates that infants who more efficiently encode visual stimuli or more efficiently recollect visual or auditory stimuli tend to perform more proficiently on traditional psychometric assessments of intelligence and language during childhood. Third, we scrutinize the assessment methods from which these continuity results derive. Fourth, we offer several models that help to explain the continuity findings. Fifth, we discuss critically the origins and the maintenance of continuity in mental development as it is coming to be conceptualized currently. Finally, we reflect on implications of continuity for the future of infant assessments specifically and for theories of early mental development generally.",10.1111/J.1467-8624.1986.TB00025.X,1483
138,147,m. woodley,The Cognitive Differentiation-Integration Effort Hypothesis: A Synthesis between the Fitness Indicator and Life History Models of Human Intelligence,2011,"This article presents a potential synthesis between the fitness indicator and life history models of human intelligence through consideration of the phenomena of ability differentiation and integration. The cognitive differentiation-integration effort hypothesis proposes that these effects result from a life history tradeoff between cognitive integration effort, a mating effort component associated with strengthening the positive manifold amongst abilities; and cognitive differentiation effort, a somatic effort component associated with the cultivation of specific abilities. This represents one of two largely independent sources of genetic variance in intelligence; the other is mediated by general fitness and mutation load and is associated with individual differences in levels of ‘genetic g‘. These two sources (along with a common source of environmental variance) combine to give rise to a variety of cognitive phenotypes characterized by different combinations of high or low levels of ‘genetic g‘ and cognitive specialism or generalism. Fundamental to this model is the assumption that measures of life history speed (K) and g are essentially independent, which is demonstrated via meta-analysis of 10 studies reporting correlations between the variables (ρ = .023, ns, n = 2056). The implications of the model are discussed in an evolutionary, ecological, and developmental context. Seven key predictions are made in the discussion which if tested could provide definitive evidence for the hypothesis.",10.1037/a0024348,1518
139,37,a. jensen,The g factor,1996,"General ability, defined as psychometric g, arises from the empirical fact that scores on various cognitive tests are positively correlated in the population. The g factor is highly stable across different factor analytic algorithms, across different test batteries and across different populations. Because all cognitive tests, from the simplest to the most complex, regardless of their informational content, are g-loaded to varying degrees, g cannot be described in terms of the tests' content, or even in psychological terms. It is actually a property of the brain. The loadings of various tests on g, from tests of sensory discrimination and reaction time to those of highly complex problem solving, predict those tests' degree of correlation with a number of non-psychometric variables: the test's heritability, inbreeding depression, coefficient of assortative mating, brain size, reaction time, brain nerve conduction velocity, brain glucose metabolic rate and features of brain evoked potentials. Although some of the brain's cognitive functions are modular, the g factor reflects the all-positive correlations among virtually all cognitive functions that show individual differences. I hypothesize that the brain contains no module for general problem solving. Correlations between individuals' performances in various cognitive tasks result from quantitative individual differences in physiological conditions that do not constitute the brain's modular and other neural design features but do influence their speed and efficiency of information processing.",10.1038/381729B0 --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11276908/,1567
140,66,g. fogarty l. stankov,Challenging the 'Law of diminishing returns',1995,"The law of diminishing returns (Spearman, 1927) states that the size of the average correlation between cognitive tasks tends to be relatively small in high-ability groups and relatively high in low-ability groups. Studies supporting this finding have tended to contrast very low-ability subjects (IQ < 78) with subjects from higher ability ranges and to use tests that have poor discriminatory power among the higher ability levels. In the first study described in this article, tasks that provide good discrimination among the higher ability levels were used. A sample of high-ability (N = 25) and of low-ability (N = 20) 15-year-old boys completed four single tests, two with low and two with high g saturations, and two competing tasks formed from these single tests. The results indicated that, contrary to the predictions of the law of diminishing returns, the amount of common variance was greater in the high-ability group. It is suggested that the law of diminishing returns does not take into account the factor of task difficulty and that there are situations in which the exact reverse of this law holds. A second study again compared correlations obtained with extreme groups (N = 28 and N = 29), this time on measures of perceptual speed, which are easy for all ability levels. Results indicated that correlations among the perceptual speed measures were the same for both groups. In neither of these studies was there any support for the law, which seems to be dependent on the very high correlations obtained from samples at the extreme lower end of the ability continuum.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160289695900241,1588

In both cases, a strong enough mutualism enables all species to persist at habitat densities where they would all be extinct in the absence of the interaction. However, a mutualistic interaction that enhances colonization enables the species to persist at lower habitat density than one that suppresses extinction. All species abruptly go extinct (catastrophe) when the habitat density is decreased infinitesimally below a critical value. A comparison of the mean field or spatially implicit case with unrestricted dispersal and colonization to all patches in the system with a spatially explicit case where dispersal is restricted to the immediate neighbours of the original patch leads to the intriguing conclusion that restricted dispersal can be favourable for species that have a beneficial effect on each other when habitat conditions are adverse. When the mutualistic interaction is strong enough, the extinction threshold or critical amount of habitat required for the persistence of all species is lower when the dispersal is locally restricted than when unrestricted ! The persistence advantage for all species created by the mutualistic interaction increases substantially with the number of species in the metacommunity, as does the advantage for restricted dispersal over global dispersal.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14766189/,1614
142,148,d. geary,"The Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence",2004,"Darwin considered an understanding of the evolution of the human mind and brain to be of major importance to the evolutionary sciences. This groundbreaking book sets out a comprehensive, integrated theory of why and how the human mind has developed to function as it does. Geary proposes that human motivational, affective, behavioral, and cognitive systems have evolved to process social and ecological information (e.g., facial expressions) that covaried with survival or reproductive options during human evolution. Further, he argues that the ultimate focus of all of these systems is to support our attempts to gain access to and control of resources - more specifically, the social (e.g., mates), biological (e.g., food), and physical (e.g., territory) resources that supported successful survival and reproduction over time. In this view, Darwin's conceptualization of natural selection as a ""struggle for existence"" becomes, for us, a struggle with other human beings for control of the available resources. This struggle provides a means of integrating modular brain and cognitive systems such as language with those brain and cognitive systems that support general intelligence. To support his arguments, Geary draws on an impressive array of recent findings in cognitive science and neuroscience as well as primatology, anthropology, and sociology. The book also explores a number of issues that are of interest in modern society, including how general intelligence relates to academic achievement, occupational status, and income.

In this study, we distinguish between ‘traditional’ methods of testing SLODR and ‘contemporary’ methods of testing SLODR. It is the former set of methods from which the vast majority of the evidence base for SLODR derives. We demonstrated that it is easy to mimic SLODR and reverse SLODR effects in these traditional methods of assessing SLODR by using data with skewed observed variable distributions. The skewness magnitudes did not need to be large to produce these effects and they fell well within the range of values that are usually considered unproblematic for parametric statistic analysis. In simulated datasets, positive subtest skewness resulted in SLODR and negative subtest skewness resulted in reverse SLODR. In contemporary methods of testing SLODR, non-linear g-loadings or a skewed g are assumed to reflect evidence for SLODR. When we applied contemporary methods of testing SLODR to these data, there was evidence of heteroscedastic residuals but no evidence of non-linear g-loadings or skewed g distributions. We broadly replicated the effects of subtest skew from these simulated datasets in real data from the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart. Results imply that traditional methods of assessing SLODR cannot distinguish between effects due to subtest characteristics that have nothing to do with differences in ability structure at different levels of g and true SLODR effects.

A sample of 101 university students was administered two intelligence tests (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery) and a large battery of ECTs. The results of this study reject the theory that some single or unitary process underlies psychometric g. Rather, it appears that individual differences in psychometric g may reflect as many as four independent components of variance. These findings support the theory that various complex mental tests correlate highly with each other, giving rise to a psychometric g factor, because they require some of the same elemental processes. Further research will be needed to determine precisely the number and nature of these components. It is also important to note that the multiple correlation of g regressed on these four components derived from elementary cognitive variables is .542. The maximum correlation possible between the psychometric variables and the battery of ECTs in this study is nearly as high as correlations among various standardized IQ tests themselves (canonical r=.603). After correction for the considerable restriction of range on IQ in the sample, the r is increased to .722. Hence, this battery of ECTs accounts for approximately half of the phenotypic variance in g and probably as much as 70% of the genotypic variance. Moreover, the finding that individual differences in conceptually distinct processes (such as speed of visual search and speed of memory search) are highly correlated indicates the presence of individual differences in some neurological level of processing common to both tasks.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016028969190003V,1796
145,149,a. slater,Can measures of infant habituation predict later intellectual ability?,1997,"By the end of the 1970s, about 50 years of research had shown fairly clearly that prediction coefficients from measures of infant behaviour to later measures of intelligence in childhood were so low as to indicate that, except in extreme cases such as severe subnormality, the early measures had no predictive validity.1 2 From about this time, however, researchers began to question the nature and validity of the infant tests on which these findings were based. It was argued that the ‘mental scales’ on these tests primarily measured perceptual and motor development, rather than mental or cognitive growth, and there is little reason to expect measures of such abilities to predict later IQ.3 4 

Accordingly, the search began for cognitive or information processing measures of infant performance which might more reasonably be considered to tap abilities that are similar to, and may be predictive of, the abilities measured by the childhood intelligence tests. A major focus of this research has been on measures of visual information processing and attentiveness, and it has become clear that a moderate degree of predictability may be possible, leading some to the view that the ‘promise of greater predictive accuracy using recognition memory and habituation rate represents one of the most exciting contemporary fields of inquiry’.5 

One of the best known and most widely used tests of infant development is the Bayley scales of infant development (BSID). In the second edition of these scales published in 1993, many items on the mental development index appear to measure perceptual-motor rather than mental or cognitive development. At 4 months the items include: #36 ‘eyes follow rod’; #44 ‘uses eye-hand coordination in reaching’; and #45 ‘picks up cube’. At 12 months the items include: #73 ‘turns pages of book’; #79 ‘fingers holes in pegboard’; and …",data/mutualism.pdf,1870

Theoretical perspectives differ in their emphasis on genetic mechanisms in explaining the longitudinal stability of cognition and how stability changes with development. However, the patterns of stability of genetic and environmental influences on cognition over the life span remain poorly understood. We searched for longitudinal studies of cognition that reported raw genetically informative longitudinal correlations or parameter estimates from longitudinal behavior genetic models. We identified 150 combinations of time points and measures from 15 independent longitudinal samples. In total, longitudinal data came from 4,548 monozygotic twin pairs raised together, 7,777 dizygotic twin pairs raised together, 34 monozygotic twin pairs raised apart, 78 dizygotic twin pairs raised apart, 141 adoptive sibling pairs, and 143 nonadoptive sibling pairs, ranging in age from infancy through late adulthood. At all ages, cross-time genetic correlations and shared environmental correlations were substantially larger than cross-time nonshared environmental correlations. Cross-time correlations for genetic and shared environmental components were, respectively, low and moderate during early childhood, increased sharply over child development, and remained high from adolescence through late adulthood. Cross-time correlations for nonshared environmental components were low across childhood and gradually increased to moderate magnitudes in adulthood. Increasing phenotypic stability over child development was almost entirely mediated by genetic factors. Time-based decay of genetic and shared environmental stability was more pronounced earlier in child development. Results are interpreted in reference to theories of gene-environment correlation and interaction.",10.1037/a0035893,1872

Phenotypic and behavioral genetic covariation between certain elemental cognitive components and scholastic performance was examined to determine (a) whether these elemental cognitive components contribute substantially to the variance of scholastic performance; (b) whether such contributions vary across different domains of school knowledge or from specific domains to a general aptitude; (c) the behavioral genetic composition of the elemental cognitive components and the scholastic variables; and (d) how the association between the cognitive components and scholastic performance is genetically and environmentally mediated. The results of the study showed that as much as 30% of the phenotypic variance of scholastic performance was accounted for by the CAT general factor, which was presumably related to mental speed. A mainly genetic covariation was found between the mental speed component and scholastic performance, although each of the two variables was strongly influenced by both heritability and common family environment. The magnitude and etiology of the covariation were largely invariant whether mental speed was related to a common scholastic aptitude or to individual achievement measures covering different knowledge domains. Taken in conjunction with previous findings that mental speed has a substantial genetic correlation with psychometric g, and psychometric g has a mostly genetic covariation with scholastic achievement, the findings of the present study seems to point to a more global picture; namely, there is a causal sequence that starts from mental speed as the explanatory factor for both psychometric g and scholastic performance, and the etiology of the causal link is chiefly genetic.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12837014/,2091
148,14,s. pinker,How could a child use verb syntax to learn verb semantics,1994,"I examine Gleitman's (1990) arguments that children rely on a verb's syntactic subcategorization frames to learn its meaning (e.g., they learn that see means ‘perceive visually’ because it can appear with a direct object, a clausal complement, or a directional phrase). First, Gleitman argues that the verbs cannot be learned byb observing then situations in which they are used , because many verbs refer to overlapping situations, and because parents do not invariably use a verb when its perceptual correlates are present. I suggest that these arguments speak only against a narrow associationist view in which the child is sensitive to the temporal contiguity of sensory features and spoken verb, If the child can hyppthesize semantic representations corresponding to what parents are likely to be referring to, and can refine such representations across multiple situations, the objections are blunted;, indeed, Gleitman's theory requires such a learning process despite her objections to it. Second, Gleitmans suggests that there is enough information in a verb's subcategorization frames to predict its meaning ‘quite closely’ . Evaluating this argument requires distinguishing a verb's root plus its semantic content (what She boiled the water shares with The water boiled and does not share with She broke the glass), and a verb frame plus its semantic perspective (what She boiled the water shares with She broke the glass and does not share with The water boiled). I show that learning a verb in a single frame only gives a learner coarse information about its semanic perspective in that frame (e.g., number of arguments, type of arguments); it tells the learner nothing about the verb root's content across frames (e.g., hot bubbling liquid). Moreover, hearing a verb across all its frames also reveals little about the verb root's content. Finally, I show that Gleitman's empirical arguments all involve experiments where children are exposed to a single verb frame, and therefore all involve learning the frame's perpective meaning, not the root's content meaning, which in all the experiments was acquired by observing the accompanying scene. I conclude that attention to a verb's syntactic frame can help narrow down the child's interpretation of the perspective meaning of the verb in that frame, but disagree with the claim that there is some in-principle limitation in learning a verb's content.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384194903476,2415
149,75,b. kooi l. kuijper s. kooijman,Consequences of symbiosis for food web dynamics,2004,"Basic Lotka-Volterra type models in which mutualism (a type of symbiosis where the two populations benefit both) is taken into account, may give unbounded solutions. We exclude such behaviour using explicit mass balances and study the consequences of symbiosis for the long-term dynamic behaviour of a three species system, two prey and one predator species in the chemostat. We compose a theoretical food web where a predator feeds on two prey species that have a symbiotic relationships. In addition to a species-specific resource, the two prey populations consume the products of the partner population as well. In turn, a common predator forages on these prey populations. The temporal change in the biomass and the nutrient densities in the reactor is described by ordinary differential equations (ODE). Since products are recycled, the dynamics of these abiotic materials must be taken into account as well, and they are described by odes in a similar way as the abiotic nutrients. We use numerical bifurcation analysis to assess the long-term dynamic behaviour for varying degrees of symbiosis. Attractors can be equilibria, limit cycles and chaotic attractors depending on the control parameters of the chemostat reactor. These control parameters that can be experimentally manipulated are the nutrient density of the inflow medium and the dilution rate. Bifurcation diagrams for the three species web with a facultative symbiotic association between the two prey populations, are similar to that of a bi-trophic food chain; nutrient enrichment leads to oscillatory behaviour. Predation combined with obligatory symbiotic prey-interactions has a stabilizing effect, that is, there is stable coexistence in a larger part of the parameter space than for a bi-trophic food chain. However, combined with a large growth rate of the predator, the food web can persist only in a relatively small region of the parameter space. Then, two zero-pair bifurcation points are the organizing centers. In each of these points, in addition to a tangent, transcritical and Hopf bifurcation a global heteroclinic bifurcation is emanating. This heteroclinic cycle connects two saddle equilibria where the predator is absent. Under parameter variation the period of the stable limit cycle goes to infinity and the cycle tends to the heteroclinic cycle. At this global bifurcation point this cycle breaks and the boundary of the basin of attraction disappears abruptly because the separatrix disappears together with the cycle. As a result, it becomes possible that a stable two-nutrient-two-prey population system becomes unstable by invasion of a predator and eventually the predator goes extinct together with the two prey populations, that is, the complete food web is destroyed. This is a form of over-exploitation by the predator population of the two symbiotic prey populations. When obligatory symbiotic prey-interactions are modelled with Liebig's minimum law, where growth is limited by the most limiting resource, more complicated types of bifurcations are found. This results from the fact that the Jacobian matrix changes discontinuously with respect to a varying parameter when another resource becomes most limiting.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15293013/,3218

The morphology and the nutrient level of the lakes differed, as did the measures applied. In some lakes biomanipulation was accompanied by reduction of the phosphorus loading. In all but two lakes, the Secchi disk transparency increased after the fish removal. Eight lakes (no phosphorus loading reduction, except for one lake) showed a strong and quick response to the measures: the bottom of the lake became visible (`lake bottom view') and there was a massive development of submerged macrophytes. In eight other lakes the water transparency increased, but lake bottom view was not obtained. In the biomanipulated lakes the decrease in total phosphorus and chlorophyll aand the increase in Secchi disk transparency were significantly stronger than the general trend occurring in Dutch lakes where no measures had been taken. The improvement in the Secchi depth and chlorophyll awas also stronger than in lakes where only the phosphorus load was reduced. The critical factor for obtaining clear water was the extent of the fish reduction in winter. Significant effects were observed only after >75% fish reduction. Success seems to require substantial fish manipulation. In such strongly biomanipulated lakes, wind resuspension of the sediment never prevented the water from becoming clear. No conclusion can be drawn with respect to the possible negative impact of cyanobacteria or Neomysison grazing by Daphniaand consequently on water clarity. In all lakes where there had been a high density of cyanobacteria or years with a high density of Neomysisother factors such as insufficient fishery may explain why lake bottom view was not obtained. In all lakes with additional phosphorus loading reduction the fish stock has been reduced less drastically (15–60%). In these lakes the effects on transparency were less pronounced than in the lakes with > 75% fish removal. Daphniagrazing seems responsible for spring clearing in all clear lakes but one. In three lakes the reduction of benthivorous fish also increased the transparency. The factors that determine water clarity in summer are less obvious. In most clear lakes a low algal biomass coincided with a macrophyte coverage of more than 25% of the lake surface area. However, it was not clear what mechanism caused the low algal biomass in summer, although inorganic nitrogen concentrations were regularly found to be very low. Daphniagrazing in open water seemed to be of little importance for suppressing the algal biomass in summer. Although in most lakes the total phosphorus concentration decreased after the biomanipulation, the dissolved phosphorus concentration remained too high to cause phosphorus limitation of the algal growth. In four out of six clear lakes for which there are long-term data the transparency decreased again after 4 years. In one lake with lower nutrient levels the Secchi disk transparency increased over the years. However, the number of lakes with low nutrient levels is too small for conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of nutrient levels on the stability of the clear water state.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017045518813,3240
151,151,e. thelen e. bates,Connectionism and dynamic systems: are they really different?,2003,"We propose that connectionism and dynamic systems theory are strong contenders for a general theory of development that holds true whatever the content domain. We illustrate, through our own career narratives, the origins of these theories in motor and language development. We situate connectionism and dynamic systems among other classic and contemporary theories and conclude that, although there are meaningful differences, these differences pale in relation to the shared assumptions about the fundamental processes and mechanisms of change. Once upon a time, thanks to Jean Piaget, the field of cognitive development had a coherent, interesting, testable, and widely accepted theory. Now, alas, we are back in the preparadigmatic boat with our colleagues in the rest of psychology, with theory fragments, almost-theories, and pseudotheories bobbing about around us. . . . I will try to differentiate several distinct possibilities for future theories. . . . Most probably each of these theories will turn out to be true of different aspects of development. . . . For any particular developmental phenomenon, one theory or another will be true, and we want to know which one it is. (Gopnik, 1996, p. 221) According to Alison Gopnik’s vision of the postPiagetian era, the search for a grand developmental theory is futile. Piaget was wrong: broad, general explanations seem ‘increasingly implausible’ (p. 221) and efforts are better spent working out the details, domain-by-domain. The traditional big issues of developmental theory ‐ nature vs. nurture, continuity and discontinuity, modularity vs. distributed processes, and so on ‐ should be cast aside in favor of specific theories about content. While we agree about the importance of the details, we also believe that Gopnik, and others who espouse the domain-specific view, have scuttled the theoretical boat somewhat prematurely. In this special issue of Developmental Science we present a discussion of two contemporary contenders for the ‘big picture’: connectionism and dynamic systems theory. The articles are the result of a symposium held at the 2001 meeting of the Society for Research in Child Development. The large audience who attended the symposium presumably did not share Gopnik’s pessimism over the future of developmental theory (although it is possible they came to witness the duel-to-the death!). Rather, we sensed a growing interest and excitement, especially as these new theories are implemented in mathematical models, and thus, make contact with similar theoretical enterprises in cognitive science, biology and neuroscience. Here we focus specifically on the question of whether we are dealing with one grand theory or two: how alike or how different are connectionism and dynamic systems? To begin, we state forthrightly that we do believe that there are general principles of development: mechanisms and processes that hold true whatever the content domain. Moreover, we assert that researchers make theoretical assumptions about these processes and mechanisms whenever they design and conduct a study. Often these assumptions are implicit, but they influence every decision about the choice of variables, design, research population, sampling intervals and statistical technique. Good theory makes these assumptions explicit, and subjects them to empirical test. Furthermore, the role of formal models is to make these underlying assumptions extremely precise. The specific form of the model is thus less important than the general principles of development on which it is based. We devote our introduction, therefore, to the developmental principles ‐ the qualitative theory and assumptions ‐ that form the bases for the two related approaches of connectionism and dynamic systems. We compare them to the assumptions of other general theories and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each. Note that there is a not-so-subtle irony here. Neither author, Bates nor Thelen, has ever programmed a computer, written an original equation, or run a simulation. How did it come",data/mutualism.pdf,4063
152,152,c. dweck,Motivational processes affecting learning.,1986,"Motivational processes influence a child's acquisition, transfer, and use of knowledge and skills, yet educationally relevant conceptions of motivation have been elusive. Using recent research within the social-cognitive framework, Dweck describes adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns and presents a research-based model of motivational processes. This model shows how the particular goals children pursue on cognitive tasks shape their reactions to success and failure and influence the quality of their cognitive performance. Dweck argues that this approach has important implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes. She presents a compelling proposal for explaining motivational influences on gender differences in mathematics achievement and observes that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies.--The Editors Most research on effective learning and performance of cognitive tasks analyzes the particular cognitive skills required to succeed at those tasks. In contrast, the focus here is on motivational processes that affect success on cognitive tasks. That is, the focus is on psychological factors, other than ability, that determine how effectively the individual acquires and uses skills. It has long been known that factors other than ability influence whether children seek or avoid challenges, whether they persist or withdraw in the face of difficulty, and whether they use and develop their skills effectively. However, the components and bases of adaptive motivational patterns have been poorly understood. As a resuit, commonsense analyses have been limited and have not provided a basis for effective practices. Indeed, many ""commonsense"" beliefs have been called into question or seriously qualified by recent research--for example, the belief that large amounts of praise and success will establish, maintain, or reinstate adaptive patterns, or that ""brighter"" children have more adaptive patterns and thus are more likely to choose personally challenging tasks or to persist in the face of difficulty. In the past 10 to 15 years a dramatic change has taken place in the study of motivation. This change has resulted in a coherent, replicable, and educationally relevant body of findings--and in a clearer understanding of motivational phenomena. During this time, the emphasis has shifted to a social-cognitive approachwaway from external contingencies, on the one hand, and global, internal states on the other. It has shifted to an emphasis on cognitive mediators, that is, to how children construe the situation, interpret events in the situation, and process information about the situation. Although external contingencies and internal affective states are by no means ignored, they are seen as part of a process whose workings are best penetrated by focusing on organizing cognitive variables. Specifically, the social-cognitive approach has allowed us to (a) characterize adaptive and maladaptive patterns, (b) explain them in terms of specific underlying processes, and thus (c) begin to provide a rigorous conceptual and empirical basis for intervention and practice. Adaptive and Maladaptive Motivational Patterns The study of motivation deals with the causes of goaloriented activity (Atkinson, 1964; Beck, 1983; Dollard & Miller, 1950; Hull, 1943; Veroff, 1969). Achievement motivation involves a particular class of goals--those involving competence--and these goals appear to fall into two classes: (a) learning goals, in which individuals seek to increase their competence, to understand or master something new, and (b) performance goals, in which individuals seek to gain favorable judgments of their competence or avoid negative judgments of their competence (Dweck & Elliott, 1983; NichoUs, 1984; Nicholls & Dweck, 1979). l Adaptive motivational patterns are those that promote the establishment, maintenance, and attainment of personally challenging and personally valued achievement goals. Maladaptive patterns, then, are associated with a failure to establish reasonable, valued goals, to maintain effective striving toward those goals, or, ultimately, to attain valued goals that are potentially within one's reach. Research has clearly documented adaptive and maladaptive patterns of achievement behavior. The adaptive (""mastery-oriented"") pattern is characterized by challenge seeking and high, effective persistence in the face of obstacles. Children displaying this pattern appear to enjoy exerting effort in the pursuit of task mastery. In contrast, the maladaptive (""helpless"") pattern is characterized by challenge avoidance and low persistence in the face of difficulty. Children displaying this pattern tend to evidence negative affect (such as anxiety) and negative self-cogniCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Carol S. Dweck, Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, 603 E. Daniel, Champaign, IL 61820. l The word performance will be used in several ways, not only in connection with performance goals. It will also be used to refer to the child's task activity (performance of a task) and to the product of that activity (level of performance). The meaning should be clear from the context. 1040 October 1986 9 American Psychologist Copyrisht 1986 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. 0003-066X/86/$00.75 Vol. 41, No. 10, 1040-1048 Table 1 Achievement Goals and Achievement Behavior Confidence in Theory of intelligence Goal orientation present ability Behavior pattern Entity theory (Intelligence is fixed) Incremental theory (Intelligence is malleable) > Performance goal (Goal is to gain positive judgments/avoid negative judgments of competence) > Learning goal (Goal is to increase competence) If high ---> Mastery-oriented Seek challenge but High persistence If low ~ Helpless Avoid challenge Low persistence If high > Mastery-oriented ioOr ~ ' Seek challenge (that fosters learning) High persistence tions when they confront obstacles (e.g., Ames, 1984; C. Diener & Dweck, 1978, 1980; Dweck & Reppucci, 1973; Nicholls, 1975). Although children displaying the different patterns do not differ in intellectual ability, these patterns can have profound effects on cognitive performance. In experiments conducted in both laboratory and classroom settings, it has been shown that children with the maladaptive pattern are seriously hampered in the acquisition and display of cognitive skills when they meet obstacles. Children with the adaptive pattern, by contrast, seem undaunted or even seem to have their performance facilitated by the increased challenge. If not ability, then what are the bases of these patterns? Most recently, research has suggested that children's goals in achievement situations differentially foster the two patterns. That is, achievement situations afford a choice of goals, and the one the child preferentially adopts predicts the achievement pattern that child will display. Table 1 summarizes the conceptualization that is emerging from the research. BasieaUy, children's theories of intelligence appear to orient them toward different goals: Children who believe intelligence is a fixed trait tend to orient toward gaining favorable judgments of that trait (performance goals), whereas children who believe intelligence is a malleable quality tend to orient toward developing that quality (learning goals). The goals then appear to set up the different behavior patterns. 2 Learning and Performance Goals Contrasted How and why do the different goals foster the different patterns? How do they shape task choice and task pursuit to facilitate or impede cognitive performance? The research reviewed below indicates that with performance goals, the entire task choice and pursuit process is built around children's concerns about their ability level. In contrast, with learning goals the choice and pursuit processes involve a focus on progress and mastery through 2 See M. Bandura and Dweck (1985), Dweck and Elliott (1983), and Leggett (1985) for a more extensive treatment of children's theories of intelligence. The present article will focus on achievement goals and their allied behavior patterns. effort. Further, this research shows how a focus on ability judgments can result in a tendency to avoid and withdraw from challenge, whereas a focus on progress through effort creates a tendency to seek and be energized by challenge. Although relatively few studies as yet have explicitly induced and compared (or measured and compared) learning versus performance goals (see M. Bandura & Dweck, 1985; Elliott & Dweck, 1985; FarreU & Dweck, 1985; Leggett, 1985, 1986), many have manipulated the salience and value of performance goals, and hence the relative value of the two types of goals. This has been done, for example, by instituting a competitive versus individual reward structure (e.g., Ames, 1984; Ames, Ames, & Felker, 1977), by varying the alleged diagnosticity of the task vis vis important abilities (e.g., Nicholls, 1975), by introducing an audience or evaluator versus allowing the individual to perform privately or focusing his or her attention on the task (e.g., Brockner & Hulton, 1978; Carver & Scheier, 1981; E. Diener & SruU, 1979), and by presenting the task with ""test"" instructions versus ""game"" or neutral instructions (e.g., Entin & Raynor, 1973; Lekarczyk & Hill, 1969; McCoy, 1965; Sarason, 1972). Taken together, the results suggest that highlighting performance goals relative to learning goals can have the following effects on achievement behavior. Goals and Task Choice Appropriately challenging tasks are often the ones that are best for utilizing and increasing one's abilities. Recent research has shown that performance goals work against the pursuit of challenge by requiring that children's perceptions of their ability be high (and remain high) before the children will desire a challenging task (M. Bandura & D",data/mutualism.pdf,10000
