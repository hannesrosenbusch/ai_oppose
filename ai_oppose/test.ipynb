      "Modern large language models generate texts that are virtually indistinguishable from those written by humans and achieve near-human performance in comprehension and reasoning tests. Yet, their complexity makes it difficult to explain and predict their functioning. We examined a state-of-the-art language model (GPT-3) using lexical decision tasks widely used to study the structure of semantic memory in humans. The results of four analyses showed that GPT-3’s patterns of semantic activation are broadly similar to those observed in humans, showing significantly higher semantic activation in related (e.g., “lime–lemon”) word pairs than in other-related (e.g., “sour–lemon”) or unrelated (e.g., “tourist–lemon”) word pairs. However, there are also significant differences between GPT-3 and humans. GPT-3’s semantic activation is better predicted by similarity in words’ meaning (i.e., semantic similarity) rather than their co-occurrence in the language (i.e., associative similarity). This suggests that GPT-3’s semantic network is organized around word meaning rather than their co-occurrence in text.\n",

      "ptext:: Compassion for others and self-compassion are assumed to be closely related concepts. Yet, as they have been mostly studied separately, little is known about their relationship and to what extent they differ or resemble each other with respect to their correlates. This cross-sectional study aimed to gain knowledge on their mean levels, interrelationship, and relationships to psychological well-being and demographic factors. A community sample of 328 adults completed a series of standardized self-report questionnaires to assess compassion for others, self-compassion, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect. Results showed that compassion for others and self-compassion were not significantly related. Self-compassion was more strongly related to negative and positive indicators of affect than compassion for others. Compassion for others was higher in women than in men, and in low educated individuals compared to higher educated individuals. In contrast, self-compassion was lower in low educated individuals. Future research can build up on these findings to enlarge the understanding of how compassion for others and self-compassion relate and differ from each other.\n",
      "ptext:: Self-compassion refers to being supportive toward oneself when experiencing suffering or pain—be it caused by personal mistakes and inadequacies or external life challenges. This review presents my theoretical model of self-compassion as comprised of six different elements: increased self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness as well as reduced self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification. It discusses the methodology of self-compassion research and reviews the increasingly large number of empirical studies that indicate self-compassion is a productive way of approaching distressing thoughts and emotions that engenders mental and physical well-being. It also reviews research that dispels common myths about self-compassion (e.g., that it is weak, selfish, self-indulgent or undermines motivation). Interventions designed to increase self-compassion, such as compassion-focused therapy and mindful self-compassion, are discussed. Finally, the review considers problematic issues in the field, such as the differential effects fallacy, and considers limitations and future research directions in the field of self-compassion research.\n",

      "ptext:: Self-compassion is natural, trainable and multi-faceted human capacity. To date there has been little research into the role of culture in influencing the conceptual structure of the underlying construct, the relative importance of different facets of self-compassion, nor its relationships to cultural values. This study employed a cross-cultural design, with 4,124 participants from 11 purposively sampled datasets drawn from different countries. We aimed to assess the relevance of positive and negative items when building the self-compassion construct, the convergence among the self-compassion components, and the possible influence of cultural values. Each dataset comprised undergraduate students who completed the “Self-Compassion Scale” (SCS). We used a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach to the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) model, separating the variability into self-compassion components (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness), method (positive and negative valence), and error (uniqueness). The normative scores of the Values Survey Module (VSM) in each country, according to the cultural dimensions of individualism, masculinity, power distance, long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence, were considered. We used Spearman coefficients (rs) to assess the degree of association between the cultural values and the variance coming from the positive and negative items to explain self-compassion traits, as well as the variance shared among the self-compassion traits, after removing the method effects produced by the item valence. The CFA applied to the MTMM model provided acceptable fit in all the samples. Positive items made a greater contribution to capturing the traits comprising self-compassion when the long-term orientation cultural value was higher (rs = 0.62; p = 0.042). Negative items did not make significant contributions to building the construct when the individualism cultural value was higher, but moderate effects were found (rs = 0.40; p = 0.228). The level of common variance among the self-compassion trait factors was inversely related to the indulgence cultural value (rs = -0.65; p = 0.030). The extent to which the positive and negative items contribute to explain self-compassion, and that different self-compassion facets might be regarded as reflecting a broader construct, might differ across cultural backgrounds.\n",
      "ptext:: Compassion and cultural competence have long been concepts fundamental to social work education. Students are taught that having compassion deepens their understanding of clients and strengthens the therapeutic bond. However, little attention has been paid to self-compassion on the part of the student and its role in working with clients of different cultures from their own. This study examined the relationship between self-compassion and cultural competence among MSW students (N=257) enrolled in a private school of social work in the northeastern United States. The measures used were the Self-Compassion Scale and the Multicultural Counseling Inventory. Results suggest that higher self-compassion predicts higher cultural competence. Implications for teaching cultural competence and directions for future research are discussed.\n",

The accuracy of these interpersonal impressions colors the way we select, shape, and maintain our social environments. In this chapter, we give an overview of the state of the art in research on the accuracy of personality judgments. First, we describe and discuss existing methodological alternatives (variable- vs. person-centered approaches, choice of accuracy criteria, individual vs. aggregated perceiver approaches). Second, we tackle the question of how well humans can judge the personality of unknown others, summarizing the wealth of existing studies across a large variety of contexts. Third, following a lens model approach, we discuss the cue-expression and cue-perception processes that mediate the amount of judgmental accuracy and summarize initial empirical process insight. Fourth, based on a process understanding we describe domains of moderators that influence how well perceivers can judge others' personalities (e.g., good trait, good judge, good target, good information). Finally, we highlight a set of issues we deem as important challenges for future research on the accuracy of personality judgments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)\n",

      "The Adjective Check List was used to gauge the personality differences among the 39 American presidents. Biographical reference works provided personality descriptions, and presidential fact books and American history compendia were sources for biographical and political data. The original 300 adjectives were reduced to 110, on which reliable assessments were feasible, and a factor analysis collapsed the data into 14 factors: Moderation, Friendliness, Intellectual Brilliance, Machiavellianism, Poise and Polish, Achievement Drive, Forcefulness, Wit, Physical Attractiveness, Pettiness, Tidiness, Conservatism, Inflexibility, and Pacifism. All but one of these factors (Pettiness) had respectable internal consistency reliability coefficients. The factor scores were further validated by correlating them with previous content-analytical and observer-based assessments and with indicators of developmental antecedents and performance criteria, including ratings of presidential greatness. Similarities in personality profiles were explored using a cluster analysis. (60 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)\n",

Although most of this work has focused on physical appearance, a growing number of studies has suggested that personality may be perceptible from other sources of information. In the current meta-analysis, we examined studies that reported accuracy and consensus effects for the perception of the Big Five traits from text-based media and online social network websites. We found substantial consensus for all five traits. Moreover, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were perceived accurately. Importantly, we provide the aggregate effect sizes that researchers might expect when examining similar phenomena to help guide future studies and discuss several potential avenues for valuable additional research in personality and person perception.\n",

      "ptext:: Abstract\n",
      "We present the Pantheon 1.0 dataset: a manually verified dataset of individuals that have transcended linguistic, temporal, and geographic boundaries. The Pantheon 1.0 dataset includes the 11,341 biographies present in more than 25 languages in Wikipedia and is enriched with: (i) manually verified demographic information (place and date of birth, gender) (ii) a taxonomy of occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation and (iii) two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views (2008–2013). We compare the Pantheon 1.0 dataset to data from the 2003 book, Human Accomplishments, and also to external measures of accomplishment in individual games and sports: Tennis, Swimming, Car Racing, and Chess. In all of these cases we find that measures of popularity (L and HPI) correlate highly with individual accomplishment, suggesting that measures of global popularity proxy the historical impact of individuals.\n",

      "ptext:: Abstract\n",
      "Modern large language models generate texts that are virtually indistinguishable from those written by humans and achieve near-human performance in comprehension and reasoning tests. Yet, their complexity makes it difficult to explain and predict their functioning. We examined a state-of-the-art language model (GPT-3) using lexical decision tasks widely used to study the structure of semantic memory in humans. The results of four analyses showed that GPT-3’s patterns of semantic activation are broadly similar to those observed in humans, showing significantly higher semantic activation in related (e.g., “lime–lemon”) word pairs than in other-related (e.g., “sour–lemon”) or unrelated (e.g., “tourist–lemon”) word pairs. However, there are also significant differences between GPT-3 and humans. GPT-3’s semantic activation is better predicted by similarity in words’ meaning (i.e., semantic similarity) rather than their co-occurrence in the language (i.e., associative similarity). This suggests that GPT-3’s semantic network is organized around word meaning rather than their co-occurrence in text.\n",

As for mental disorder, there is evidence from prospective data that traits are predictive of future health. In this case, the most salient trait is conscientiousness; its associations with better health appear to reflect multiple causal pathways, including individual differences in health behaviors.

      "Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis.\n",
      "Discussion for Researchers\n",
      "There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections.\n",
      "Discussion for Readers\n",
      "When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.\n",

      "ptext:: Abstract\n",
      "Modern large language models generate texts that are virtually indistinguishable from those written by humans and achieve near-human performance in comprehension and reasoning tests. Yet, their complexity makes it difficult to explain and predict their functioning. We examined a state-of-the-art language model (GPT-3) using lexical decision tasks widely used to study the structure of semantic memory in humans. The results of four analyses showed that GPT-3’s patterns of semantic activation are broadly similar to those observed in humans, showing significantly higher semantic activation in related (e.g., “lime–lemon”) word pairs than in other-related (e.g., “sour–lemon”) or unrelated (e.g., “tourist–lemon”) word pairs. However, there are also significant differences between GPT-3 and humans. GPT-3’s semantic activation is better predicted by similarity in words’ meaning (i.e., semantic similarity) rather than their co-occurrence in the language (i.e., associative similarity). This suggests that GPT-3’s semantic network is organized around word meaning rather than their co-occurrence in text.\n",

      "When time is limited, researchers may be faced with the choice of using an extremely brief measure of the Big-Five personality dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.\n",

      "ptext:: Abstract\n",
      "Recent work in the study of legislative politics has uncovered associations between the Big Five personality traits and myriad phenomena in the United States Congress. This literature raises new questions about political representation in terms of the Big Five, specifically, whether voters are more likely to support legislators with similar personality traits to their own, who would presumably have similar process preferences, or legislators with valence personality traits, regardless of congruence, which are associated with better leadership. We first revisit the measurement validity of voter assessments of legislator personality in the 2014 and 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies to demonstrate that such survey items are meaningful. Subsequently, we use these data to construct measures of personality congruence and valence and apply them to predict voters’ job approval of legislators. Our results support the claim that voters evaluate legislators’ job performance on the basis of perceived valence traits rather than legislators’ congruence to voters’ own personality dispositions.\n",

      "ptext:: Abstract\n",
      "My goal in this chapter is to survey what political psychologists know, and have yet to discover, about impression formation and impression management. The processes are two sides of the same coin, and my starting presumption is a simple one: a complete understanding of what ordinary citizens think about politicians will be out of reach until political psychologists take into account the strategic interplay between elites and the mass public. Although this presumption is simple and perhaps obvious, a word of warning is in order at the outset: empirical research rarely grapples with the explicit connections between the two processes. Jervis (2002) makes exactly this point in his recent call for unifying the study of \"signaling and perception\" in international politics, when he contends that \"what we need are studies that are two-sided in looking at both the actor and the perceiver\" (p. 308). Unfortunately, the two topics--how citizens think about politicians and the strategic attempts by politicians to influence those perceptions--occupy separate shelves in our offices and separate chapters in scholarly treatments. Crossfertilization between the two literatures is rare. As a consequence, the manifest empirical links between the two processes are few and far between. I will try to make some limited steps in linking the two, but my ultimate goal is to challenge the next generation of scholars in political psychology to develop research agendas that more fully integrate these perspectives.

A facial recognition algorithm was applied to naturalistic images of 1,085,795 individuals to predict their political orientation by comparing their similarity to faces of liberal and conservative others. Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%). Accuracy was similar across countries (the U.S., Canada, and the UK), environments (Facebook and dating websites), and when comparing faces across samples. Accuracy remained high (69%) even when controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity. Given the widespread use of facial recognition, our findings have critical implications for the protection of privacy and civil liberties.\n",

      "Cultural stereotypes such as the idea that men are more suited for paid work and women are more suited for taking care of the home and family, may contribute to gender imbalances in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, among other undesirable gender disparities. Might these stereotypes be learned from language? Here we examine whether gender stereotypes are reflected in the large-scale distributional structure of natural language semantics. We measure gender associations embedded in the statistics of 25 languages and relate these to data on an international dataset of psychological gender associations (N = 656,636). People’s implicit gender associations are strongly predicted by gender associations encoded in the statistics of the language they speak. These associations are further related to the extent that languages mark gender in occupation terms (for example, ‘waiter’/‘waitress’). Our pattern of findings is consistent with the possibility that linguistic associations shape people’s implicit judgements.\n",
