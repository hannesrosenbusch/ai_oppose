The researchers applied a hedonic pricing model to 15,716 Airbnb listings. As expected, the results show that physical characteristics, location, and host characteristics significantly impact price. Interestingly, more reviews are associated with a drop in price. This information is useful to hosts who are forming a pricing strategy for their listings as well as for Airbnb, who needs to support them. The paper raises important questions about pricing in the sharing economy and suggests avenues for future research in this area.",10.1080/10548408.2017.1308292

I estimate that Asian hosts earn 4–5%, and Black male hosts 3%, less than White males for the same type of property. However, controlling for more observables weakens the effects, requiring a cautious interpretation of these point estimates. I use two proxies for the number of bookings a listing has to estimate whether a demand or supply shift is responsible for the price disparity.

prodosh e. simlai,Predicting owner-occupied housing values using machine learning: an empirical investigation of California census tracts data,2021,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we introduce machine-learning (ML) methods to evaluate one of the key concepts of real estate analysis – the prediction of housing prices in the presence of a large number of covariates. We use several supervised ML tools that are based on regularisation methods – notably Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net regressions – and discuss their relative performance in comparison to conventional OLS-based methods. Our empirical results show that the supervised ML methods provide a comprehensive description of the determinants of owner-occupied housing values in the census tracts of California. We find that, compared to the familiar worlds of OLS and WLS, the Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net regressions provide relatively better out-of-sample predictions. Among the benefits of shrinkage-based ML methods are their ability to resolve such issues as variable selection and overfitting.",10.1080/09599916.2021.1890187
ulrich gunter i. önder,Determinants of Airbnb demand in Vienna and their implications for the traditional accommodation industry,2018,"This study identifies key determinants of Airbnb demand and quantifies their marginal contributions in terms of demand elasticities. A comprehensive cross-sectional data set of all Viennese Airbnb listings that were active between July 2015 and June 2016 is examined. Estimation results, which are obtained by cluster-robust ordinary least squares, show that Airbnb demand in Vienna is price-inelastic. Significant positive drivers include listing size, number of photos, and responsiveness of the host. Significant negative drivers include listing price, distance from the city center, and response time of the host. Implications for the traditional accommodation industry are that, on the one hand, it should better communicate its sought-after advantages (e.g. lower average minimum duration of stay). On the other hand, it should increase its offer of bigger and better equipped hotel rooms since hosting more than two guests at a time is one of the major benefits of Airbnb.",10.1177/1354816617731196

Previous research suggests that consumers rely on this information to discriminate against hosts from racial minorities. If there is a preference for White hosts, then they should be able to charge higher prices for qualitatively similar rentals. We test this hypothesis using data from Airbnb. An analysis of 96,150 listings across 24 cities and 14 countries showed that non-White hosts charge approximately 2.5%–3% lower prices for qualitatively similar listings (study 1). A preregistered analysis of 12,648 listings across 14 cities in the United States showed that Black hosts charge approximately 5%–7% lower prices and Asian hosts charge approximately 4%–6% lower prices for similar listings (study 2). These findings support the hypothesis that consumers show a preference for White hosts, which allows White hosts to charge higher prices.",10.1086/722700

The purpose of this study was to investigate tourists’ motivations for using Airbnb and to segment them accordingly. The study involved an online survey completed in 2015 by more than 800 tourists who had stayed in Airbnb accommodation during the previous 12 months. Aggregate results indicated that respondents were most strongly attracted to Airbnb by its practical attributes, and somewhat less so by its experiential attributes. An exploratory factor analysis identified five motivating factors—Interaction, Home Benefits, Novelty, Sharing Economy Ethos, and Local Authenticity. A subsequent cluster analysis divided the respondents into five segments—Money Savers, Home Seekers, Collaborative Consumers, Pragmatic Novelty Seekers, and Interactive Novelty Seekers. Profiling of the segments revealed numerous distinctive characteristics. Various practical and conceptual implications of the findings are discussed.",10.1177/0047287517696980
"benjamin edelman, michael luca,",Digital Discrimination: The Case of Airbnb.com,2014,"Online marketplaces often contain information not only about products, but also about the people selling the products. In an effort to facilitate trust, many platforms encourage sellers to provide personal profiles and even to post pictures of themselves. However, these features may also facilitate discrimination based on sellers' race, gender, age, or other aspects of appearance. In this paper, we test for racial discrimination against landlords in the online rental marketplace Airbnb.com. Using a new data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about quality of the rentals, we show that non-black hosts charge approximately 12% more than black hosts for the equivalent rental. These effects are robust when controlling for all information visible in the Airbnb marketplace. These findings highlight the prevalence of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust.",data/airbnb.pdf
"katrine berg nødtvedt, hallgeir sjåstad, siv skard, helge thorbjørnsen, j. v. van bavel,",Racial Bias in the Sharing Economy and the Role of Trust and Self-Congruence,2020,"We investigated whether people engage in racial discrimination in the sharing economy, and how such discrimination might be explained and mitigated. Using a set of carefully controlled experiments (N = 1,599), including a pre-registered study on a nationally representative sample, we find causal evidence for racial discrimination. When an identical Airbnb apartment is presented with a racial out-group (vs. in-group) host, people report more negative attitudes towards the apartment, lower intentions to rent it, and are 25% less likely to choose the apartment over a standard hotel room in an incentivized choice. Reduced self-congruence with apartments owned by out-group hosts mediates these effects. However, racial discrimination disappears when the apartment is presented with an explicit trust cue, in the form of a visible top-rating by other consumers (5/5 stars). This suggests that a reputation-based trust cue can counteract the tendency to engage in costly discrimination against products and services provided by out-group members.",data/airbnb.pdf

Such subtle behaviors often cause harm, even if recipients do not perceive them. Affected individuals may become desensitized, indifferent, or even accepting of this inferior treatment. In this research, we measure and compare actual and perceived service between providers and ethnoracial (ER) consumers. In the context of banking, study 1 of three compares satisfaction ratings across ER consumers (UER and White) and examines actual behaviors of employees across video recordings of service encounters. Study 2 employs a video scenario experiment to demonstrate how ER consumer perceptions differ in evaluating the same encounter. In study 3, subjects evaluate positive and negative service encounters. Our findings show that if actual service is objectively measured, then managers and policy makers will be able to identify and address undetected instances of discrimination.",data/airbnb.pdf

We quantify users’ preferences for quality signals in monetary terms and evidence comparative disadvantage of Middle Eastern descent male names for drivers and co-travelers. It translates into a lower willingness to accept and pay for an offer. Market simulations confirm the robustness of the findings.

Specifically, this study included 20 individuals seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline. We identify success factors of the digital-sharing economy to these populations, identify shortcomings and propose mitigation strategies based on prior research related to trust, social capital and theories of collective efficacy. Finally, we contribute new principles that may foster collaborative consumption within this population and identify new concepts for practical employment applications among these populations.",data/airbnb.pdf

Here we analyze more than 100,000 Airbnb rentals to test whether consumers discriminate against hosts from racial minorities. If consumers prefer to stay with a White host, then hosts from racial minorities should be able to charger lower prices for similar rentals.

Evidence from 97 Field Experiments of Racial Discrimination in Hiring,2019,"Comparing levels of discrimination across countries can provide a window into large-scale social and political factors often described as the root of discrimination. Because of difficulties in measurement, however, little is established about variation in hiring discrimination across countries. We address this gap through a formal meta-analysis of 97 field experiments of discrimination incorporating more than 200,000 job applications in nine countries in Europe and North America. We find significant discrimination against nonwhite natives in all countries in our analysis; discrimination against white immigrants is present but low. However, discrimination rates vary strongly by country: In high-discrimination countries, white natives receive nearly twice the callbacks of nonwhites; in low-discrimination countries, white natives receive about 25 percent more. France has the highest discrimination rates, followed by Sweden. We find smaller differences among Great Britain, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, the United States, and Germany.

sterling a. bone glenn l. christensen jerome d. williams,"Rejected, shackled, and alone: The impact of systemic restricted choice on minority consumers’ construction of self.",2014,"This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed.",10.1086/676689
"mehdi farajallah, r. hammond, t. pénard,",What Drives Pricing Behavior in Peer-to-Peer Markets? Evidence from the Carsharing Platform BlaBlaCar,2016,"How are prices and market outcomes determined on peer-to-peer platforms? More importantly, how should we expect price-setting and demand behavior to change as these markets mature? We provide the first empirical analysis of the world’s leading carsharing platform, BlaBlaCar. Our econometric model explicitly accounts for the joint determination of price and quantity demanded and finds that pricing decisions evolve as drivers gain experience with the platform. More-experienced drivers set lower prices and, controlling for price, sell more seats. Our interpretation is that more-experienced drivers on BlaBlaCar learn to lower their prices as they gain experience. Further, we find that driver demographics matter. The demographic characteristic with the quantitatively largest effect is for drivers with an Arabic-sounding name, for whom there is meaningfully lower demand, despite the fact that these drivers set lower prices. In total, our results suggest that peer-to-peer markets such as BlaBlaCar share some characteristics with other types of peer-to-peer markets such as eBay but remain a unique and rich setting in which there are many new insights to be gained.",data/airbnb.pdf
s. hati t. balqiah arga hananto elevita yuliati,A decade of systematic literature review on Airbnb: the sharing economy from a multiple stakeholder perspective,2021,"Airbnb, which launched its business in 2009, has experienced explosive growth by creating value through the sharing economy business model. The Airbnb business model helps property owners exploit underutilized assets. However, along with its rapid growth, controversies have arisen among many stakeholders, especially the traditional hotel industry, communities, and policymakers. This study reviews academic articles to pinpoint the factors involved in the relationships among Airbnb and its multiple stakeholders. The aim is to identify the benefits, drawbacks, and issues surrounding Airbnb. The analysis is based on the perspectives of six Airbnb stakeholders: guests, hosts, employees, communities, competitors, and policymakers. A variety of scholarly journals indexed in the Scopus database were reviewed, with 282 included in the final analysis. The analysis will be useful for academics, practitioners, and policymakers alike, as it summarizes the Airbnb relevant actors, identifies key factors that influence stakeholder behavior, and assesses the power and level of influence of each stakeholder. Ultimately, the study points to potential directions for future research on Airbnb.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08222 --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34754973/
shahar sansani,Ethnic Discrimination Against Landlords in the Rental Housing Market,2020,"In this paper, we examine ethnic discrimination against landlords by analyzing whether Arab (minority) landlords receive fewer inquiries than Jewish (non-minority) landlords for available apartments for rent. Two hundred and forty-eight fictitious advertisements for apartments for rent were advertised, half with names signaling Jewish individuals and half with names signaling Arab individuals. Moreover, the amount of information regarding the apartments was varied, as half of the advertisements included pictures and a longer description of the apartments, decreasing the uncertainty regarding potential landlords. Finally, through contact-sharing smartphone applications, we examine the ethnicity of the individuals calling each type of advertisement. The main finding is that Jewish landlords receive 36 percent more inquiries overall than Arab landlords, from 29 percent more unique phone numbers than Arab landlords. This finding holds for both high-information and low-information listings. In addition, we find that the more left-leaning a city is politically, the smaller the difference in inquiries between the two types of landlords. Finally, we find that the difference in inquiries received is driven by non-Arab (Jewish) potential tenants.",10.2139/ssrn.3578468

This article sets out to inspect “why the sharing economy is so successful” and provide a critical viewpoint on the topic's essential ideas, while also taking a perspective on the advantages and disadvantages that affect the end users. A literature review paired with case studies of Airbnb, Uber, and other applications of the shared economy, looks upon how despite their rapid market growth in the past decade and public approval, such platforms caused disruptions to the markets they operate in. Results indicate that by being involved as a part of the collaborative consumption ecosystem, either as a provider or a user, the absence of personal ownership is key, while the utilisation of the product needs to be maximised to result in a pleasant experience. However, it is critical that the development of these platforms which thrive on connecting people stays closely monitored by regulatory bodies, and that the legislation needed for prevention of unethical practices follows quickly enough to ensure rightful operation.",10.1017/pds.2023.350
paschalis arvanitidis a. economou georgios grigoriou c. kollias,Trust in peers or in the institution? A decomposition analysis of Airbnb listings’ pricing,2020,"ABSTRACT The present paper examines whether Airbnb listing prices differ significantly between ‘casual’ hosts and hosts with multiple listings, regarded as professionals. To this effect the Airbnb apartment market in Athens (Greece) is used as a case study. Drawing on a sample of about 3.500 Airbnb apartments listed in May 2017, the study employs, first, typical hedonic price modelling to assess the determinants of listings’ price of both groups, and then it uses the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition methodology to examine whether there is a price gap between casual and professional hosts, the characteristics that cause this price gap and their relative contribution to it. The research finds a statistically significant difference in the Airbnb pricing between casual and professional hosts, where about a half of the price gap is attributed to the ‘better’ listings that professionals manage (in terms of size, availability of amenities and locational attributes), and a half to the different reaction hosts have towards specific Airbnb characteristics. In particular, professionals value higher (i.e. place more trust on) the Superhost badge issued by Airbnb as an institution, whereas casual hosts place trust on (and price accordingly) the evaluations provided by the guests.",10.1080/13683500.2020.1806794

However, the sharing economy’s implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy’s impact on marketing’s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy’s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction.",10.1177/0022242919861929
miroslav tushev fahime ebrahimi anas mahmoud,A Systematic Literature Review of Anti-Discrimination Design Strategies in the Digital Sharing Economy,2022,"Applications of the Digital Sharing Economy (DSE), such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have become a main facilitator of economic growth and shared prosperity in modern-day societies. However, recent research has revealed that the participation of minority groups in DSE activities is often hindered by different forms of bias and discrimination. Evidence of such behavior has been documented across almost all domains of DSE, including ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. However, little is known about the underlying design decisions of DSE platforms which allow certain demographics of the market to gain unfair advantage over others. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper, we systematically synthesize evidence from 58 interdisciplinary studies to identify the pervasive discrimination concerns affecting DSE platforms along with their triggering features and mitigation strategies. Our objective is to consolidate such interdisciplinary evidence from a software design point of view. Our results show that existing evidence is mainly geared towards documenting and mitigating issues of racism and sexism affecting platforms of ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. Our review further shows that discrimination concerns in the DSE market are commonly enabled by features of user profiles and commonly impact reputation systems.",10.1109/TSE.2021.3139961
daniel a. guttentag,Airbnb: disruptive innovation and the rise of an informal tourism accommodation sector,2015,"This article explores the emergence of Airbnb, a company whose website permits ordinary people to rent out their residences as tourist accommodation. The company was just recently established, but it has grown extremely rapidly and is now selling many millions of room nights annually. This rise is examined through the lens of disruptive innovation theory, which describes how products that lack in traditionally favoured attributes but offer alternative benefits can, over time, transform a market and capture mainstream consumers. The concepts of disruptive innovation are used to consider Airbnb's novel business model, which is built around modern internet technologies, and Airbnb's distinct appeal, which centres on cost-savings, household amenities, and the potential for more authentic local experiences. Despite Airbnb's growing popularity, many Airbnb rentals are actually illegal due to short-term rental regulations. These legality issues and their corresponding tax concerns are discussed, with an overview of the current state of regulatory flux and a possible path for resolution. Thereafter, the article considers Airbnb's potential to significantly disrupt the traditional accommodation sector, and the positive and negative impacts Airbnb may have on destinations. Finally, numerous questions for future research are proposed.",10.1080/13683500.2013.827159
bastian jaeger willem w. a. sleegers a. evans,Automated classification of demographics from face images: A tutorial and validation,2018,"Examining disparities in social outcomes as a function of gender, age, or race has a long tradition in psychology and other social sciences. With an increasing availability of large naturalistic data sets, researchers are afforded the opportunity to study the effects of demographic characteristics with real-world data and high statistical power. However, since traditional studies rely on human raters to asses demographic characteristics, limits in participant pools can hinder researchers from analyzing large data sets. Automated procedures offer a new solution to the classification of face images. Here, we present a tutorial on how to use two face classification algorithms, Face++ and Kairos. We also test and compare their accuracy under varying conditions and provide practical recommendations for their use. Drawing on two face databases (n = 2,805 images), we find that classification accuracy is (a) relatively high, with Kairos generally outperforming Face++ (b) similar for standardized and more variable images, and (c) dependent on target demographics. For example, accuracy was lower for Hispanic and Asian (vs. Black and White) targets. In sum, we propose that automated face classification can be a useful tool for researchers interested in studying the effects of demographic characteristics in large naturalistic data sets.",10.1111/SPC3.12520

We discuss principles of the S-D logic and transformative service research and explore the processes of value co-creation and co-destruction of well-being within the ecosystem of the accommodation sharing economy. Following a brief period of euphoria, the dark side of the sharing economy emerges, defined as the socially, environmentally, or economically undesirable effects introduced by the sharing economy. Airbnb introduced new realities for visitors, neighborhoods, the accommodation industry, and city councils, whereby some stakeholders are frequently found to maximize their own value at the expense of others. Value co-destruction prevails often due to uncontrolled and rapid expansion. We seek to promote a more balanced process, and the optimization of value co-creation, while seeking to prevent value co-destruction. Using a literature review, netnography, and a case study, we investigate co-creation and co-destruction, as expressed by different stakeholders, and focus on the socio-psychological implications in the use of sharing platforms that affect the well-being of individuals and community. A conceptual framework is proposed to manage future research addressing well-being, value co-creation and co-destruction in complex ecosystem service networks.",data/airbnb.pdf
miroslav tushev fahime ebrahimi anas mahmoud,Digital Discrimination in Sharing Economy A Requirements Engineering Perspective,2020,"Recent evidence has revealed that Sharing Economy platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have become active hubs for digital discrimination. This new form of discrimination refers to a phenomenon where a business transaction is influenced by race, gender, age, or any other non-business related characteristic of providers or consumers. Existing research often tackles this problem from a socio-economic and regulatory points of view. However, the research on the design aspects of Sharing Economy software, which enable such complex sociotechnical problems to emerge online, is still underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a new perspective on digital discrimination, tackling the problem from a Requirements Engineering point of view. Specifically, we analyze a large dataset of online user feedback as well as synthesize existing literature to identify and classify pervasive discrimination concerns in the Sharing Economy market. Based on this analysis, we devise a crowd-driven domain model to represent these concerns along with their relations to the functional features and user goals of Sharing Economy platforms. This model is intended to provide requirements engineers, working on Sharing Economy software, with systematic insights into the complex types of socio-technical problems that can emerge in the operational environments of their systems.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00031
y. suparman h. folmer j. oud,Hedonic price models with omitted variables and measurement errors: a constrained autoregression–structural equation modeling approach with application to urban Indonesia,2013,"Omitted variables and measurement errors in explanatory variables frequently occur in hedonic price models. Ignoring these problems leads to biased estimators. In this paper, we develop a constrained autoregression–structural equation model (ASEM) to handle both types of problems. Standard panel data models to handle omitted variables bias are based on the assumption that the omitted variables are time-invariant. ASEM allows handling of both time-varying and time-invariant omitted variables by constrained autoregression. In the case of measurement error, standard approaches require additional external information which is usually difficult to obtain. ASEM exploits the fact that panel data are repeatedly measured which allows decomposing the variance of a variable into the true variance and the variance due to measurement error. We apply ASEM to estimate a hedonic housing model for urban Indonesia. To get insight into the consequences of measurement error and omitted variables, we compare the ASEM estimates with the outcomes of (1) a standard SEM, which does not account for omitted variables, (2) a constrained autoregression model, which does not account for measurement error, and (3) a fixed effects hedonic model, which ignores measurement error and time-varying omitted variables. The differences between the ASEM estimates and the outcomes of the three alternative approaches are substantial.",10.1007/s10109-013-0186-3 --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-013-0186-3
m. ferreri r. sanyal,Platform economies and urban planning: Airbnb and regulated deregulation in London,2018,"The ‘sharing economy’ has become a new buzzword in urban life as digital technology companies set up online platforms to link together people and un- or underutilised assets with those seeking to rent them for short periods of time. While cloaked under the rhetoric of ‘sharing’, the exchanges they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing. While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate interests with public good. Finally, we address proposals for using algorithms and big data as means of urban governance and argue that the schism between regulation and enforcement is opening up new digitally mediated spaces of informal practices in cities.",10.1177/0042098017751982
m. brewer,In-group bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis.,1979,"Experimental research on intergroup discrimination in favor of one's own group is reviewed in terms of the basis of differentiati on between in-group and outgroup and in terms of the response measure on which in-group bias is assessed. Results of the research reviewed suggest that (a) factors such as intergroup competition, similarity, and status differentials affect in-group bias indirectly by influencing the salience of distinctions between in-group and out-group, (b) the degree of intergroup differentiation on a particular response dimension is a joint function of the relevance of intergroup distinctions and the favorableness of the in-group's position on that dimension, and (c) the enhancement of in-group bias is more related to increased favoritism toward in-group members than to increased hostility toward out-group members. The implications of these results for positive applications of group identification are discussed. In 1906, sociologist William Sumner articulated a functionalist approach to the nature of intergroup attitudes in his exposition of the concept of ethnocentrism . The differentiation of peoples into distinct ethnic groups originates, according to Sumner, in context of the ""conditions of the struggle for existence."" At the individual level, the psychological consequences of this differentiation both reflect and sustain the basic state of conflict between the in-group (or ""we-group"") and out-groups (or ""others-groups""):",10.1037/0033-2909.86.2.307
michael bar nishanlang khonglah,Racial differences in access to mortgage lending: comparison across major institutions,2022,"We use the 2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset to measure racial bias in residential loan approval across the 20 largest mortgage granting institutions in the US. This data set reflects the changes in reporting requirements implemented from 2018 onwards, and include important variables that were missing from previous HMDA public samples. We observe large variation in unexplained race gaps across institutions, ranging 1.9–13.2% points for Black applicants, and 0.2–8.1% points for Hispanic applicants. The nationwide estimates are close to the middle of these ranges, and therefore mask the wide variation across institutions. We argue that comparison across major institutions reduces the impact of omitted-variable bias, which cast doubt on previous findings of “discrimination” based on HMDA public data. For such cross-institutions gaps to be driven by omitted variables, it would require unusual sorting of minority applicants across institutions. Our findings of possible discrimination are quite compelling due to (i) newly available variables, (ii) comparison across institutions, and (iii) the use of Oaxaca–Blinder–Fairlie decomposition, which reduces the bias due to the omission of variables correlated with race. We advocate for internal and external fair-lending reviews of institutions, starting with the ones at the top of our list in terms of unexplained race gaps and for publicizing the credit approval formulas used by institutions.",10.1007/s43546-022-00276-5 --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-022-00276-5
david g. blanchflower david g. blanchflower david g. blanchflower,International evidence on well-being,2008,"National Time Accounting is a way of measuring society's well-being, based on time use. Its explicit form is the U-index, for ""unpleasant"" or ""undesirable"", which measures the proportion of time an individual spends in an unpleasant state. In this paper I review cross-country evidence on happiness and life satisfaction and consider whether these data will likely be replaced by the U-index. I find that first, that there are many similarities. According to both measures happiness is higher for the more educated, for married people, for those with higher income and for whites and lower for the unemployed; is U-shaped in age and un-trended over time in the USA although they are trended up in a number of EU countries and especially so in developing countries. Equivalent results are found using self-reported unhappiness data. Second, there is a large body of data on happiness that is unavailable on the U-index. For example, according to happiness research well-being across nations is lower the higher is the unemployment rate, the current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life. Higher inequality also lowers happiness. Third, we know little about the predictive power of the U-index. Happiness and life satisfaction data seem able to forecast migration flows. Fourth, happy people are particularly optimistic about the future.

jennifer l. doleac l. stein,The Visible Hand: Race and Online Market Outcomes,2010,"We examine the effect of race on market outcomes by selling iPods through local online classified advertisements throughout the United States in a year-long field experiment. Each ad features a photograph of the product being held by a dark- or light-skinned (“black” or “white”) hand. To provide context, we also consider a group of sellers against whom buyers might statistically discriminate for similar reasons: white sellers with wrist tattoos. Black sellers do worse than white sellers on a variety of market outcome measures: They receive 13% fewer responses and 17% fewer offers. These effects are strongest in the Northeast, and are similar in magnitude to those associated with the display of a wrist tattoo. Conditional on receiving at least one offer, black sellers also receive 2–4% lower offers, despite the selfselected—and presumably less biased—pool of buyers. In addition, buyers corresponding with black sellers exhibit lower trust: They are 17% less likely to include their name in e-mails, 44% less likely to accept delivery by mail, and 56% more likely to express concern about making a long-distance payment. We find evidence that black sellers suffer particularly poor outcomes in thin markets; it appears that discrimination may not “survive” in the presence of significant competition among buyers. Furthermore, black sellers do worst in the most racially isolated markets and markets with high property crime rates, consistent with channels through which we might expect statistical discrimination to operate.",10.1111/ecoj.12082
ruomeng cui jun li dennis j. zhang,Reducing Discrimination with Reviews in the Sharing Economy: Evidence from Field Experiments on Airbnb,2016,"Recent research has found widespread discrimination by hosts against guests of certain races in online marketplaces, which endangers the very basis of a sharing economy — building trust in the communities. In this paper, we explore the root cause of discrimination and how to eliminate discrimination. We conducted two randomized field experiments among 1,256 hosts on Airbnb by creating fictitious guest accounts and sending accommodation requests to them. We find that requests from guests with distinctively African American names are 19 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those with distinctively White names. However, a public review posted on a guest’s page mitigates discrimination: when guest accounts receive a positive review, the acceptance rates of guest accounts with distinctively White and African American names are statistically indistinguishable. We further demonstrate that a negative review also eliminates discrimination. Our finding is consistent with statistical discrimination: when lacking perfect information, hosts infer the quality of a guest by race and make rental decisions based on the average predicted quality of each racial group; when enough information is shared, hosts do not need to infer guests’ quality from their race, and discrimination is eliminated. Our results offer direct and clear guidance for sharing-economy platforms on how to reduce discrimination. Platform owners should motivate users to write reviews of one another and design a better mechanism to facilitate information sharing — especially information that signals guest quality.",10.2139/ssrn.2882982
venoo kakar j. voelz j. wu j. franco,The Visible Host: Does race guide Airbnb rental rates in San Francisco?,2017,"Peer to Peer e-commerce is increasingly characterized by trends towards the personalization of buyers and sellers in the on-line marketplace. This personalization includes buyer reviews, personal pictures and profiles, and other biographical information intended to reduce buyers’ perceived “purchase risk” or to facilitate trust in the sellers. However, this phenomenon is transforming what started as an essentially “anonymous” market to one susceptible to traditional market failures, including potential racial discrimination, in a manner similar to its brick and mortar counterparts. In this paper, we examine the effect of on-line host information (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) on the price of available rental listings in San Francisco on Airbnb.com. We find that on average, Asian and Hispanic hosts charge 8%-10% lower prices relative to their White counterparts on equivalent rental properties, after controlling for all renter-available information on rental unit characteristics, as well as additional information on neighborhood property values, area demographics, and occupancy rates. We do not find any differences in occupancy rates between minority and White hosts. This may suggest that minorities price lower because they are forward-looking, perhaps due to an expectation of discrimination in the online marketplace or have a preference to increase demand to either maintain their target occupancy level or to attract a larger pool of potential renters to choose from. Overall, our findings are consistent with but not conclusive of a market test of potential racial discrimination affecting Hispanic Airbnb hosts, manifested in an anticipation of disparate market demand for their rentals, and responded to by lower listing prices.",10.1016/J.JHE.2017.08.001 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137716301309
waqar nadeem saifeddin alimamy a. r. ashraf,Navigating through difficult times with ethical marketing: Assessing consumers' willingness-to-pay in the sharing economy,2023,"The pandemic has severely disrupted the activity and economic growth of co-working spaces, ridesharing, couch surfing, and other services known collectively as the “sharing economy.” Academicians and managers are exploring and experimenting with various strategies to recover losses, build meaningful connections with consumers, and optimize consumer engagement. As the sharing economy strives to recover from pandemic-induced losses, it is crucial to consider factors that might help sharing-economy firms navigate through difficult times. Moreover, value-co creation has been addressed previously in sharing economy research as a unidimensional construct with constrained applicability. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response (S–O-R) framework, the present study focuses on ethical marketing as a strategy for identifying consumer responses—including value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay—that may benefit sharing-economy firms. We have collected the empirical data from n = 403 consumers in the sharing economy. Analyses through structural equation modelling tests reveal that ethical marketing influence value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay. Contrary to our expectations, value co-creation has no influence on consumers' willingness to pay; however, the relationship between value co-creation and consumers' willingness to pay is fully mediated by self–brand connection. Based on empirical results, this study contributes to existing theoretical knowledge regarding ethical marketing and value co-creation literature in the sharing economy and proposes practical implications, including how consumers would be willing to co-create value, establish a self–brand connection, and are more likely to pay in response to ethical marketing.",10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103150 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002430

Through a systematic review of the literature on this topic, the authors aim to offer a synthesis of research approaches and to provide proposals for future research.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted searches in four different databases, to select articles based on the inclusion criteria: the articles should combine the topics of innovation and hospitality/tourism and have been published between 2011 and 2021. Through an iterative screening process, the authors selected 71 research articles.FindingsThis paper distinguishes two categories of approaches to the topic: a first and predominant approach in which innovations are derived from evolving ethical insights and a more dispersed second category that explores the ethical implications of innovations. In the first category, articles about ethical leadership represent the greatest number, followed by those about corporate social responsibility (CSR). Almost half of the papers studied followed qualitative methods.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that the prevalent perspective represents a specific interpretation of the social role of private companies, but that the ethical effects of commercial or technological innovations deserve more attention. Despite a rigorous procedure in reviewing the literature systematically, they also discuss that there are multiple relevant debates that do not refer explicitly to ethical aspects, but that should be included in the topic.Practical implicationsAddressing the research gaps in ethics and innovation in hospitality must provide practitioners with an understanding of the ramifications of their innovations and with criteria for ethical decision-making.Social implicationsThe current orientation of the debate underscores ethical innovations in hospitality and tourism, whilst ethical risks of other developments in these industries may remain understudied.Originality/valueThis review updates earlier reviews of ethical issues in hospitality and tourism, whilst the link to innovation and the distinction of two categories, based on the causal direction between ethical considerations and innovation, identify an imbalance in the study of the topic.",10.1108/jhti-11-2021-0305

The authors suggest that it is due time to take a step back and assess the current state of affairs. This paper aims to conflate and synthesize research on Airbnb.Design/methodology/approachTo facilitate research on Airbnb and its underlying principles in electronic commerce, the authors present a structured literature review on Airbnb.FindingsThe findings are based on 118 articles from the fields of tourism, information and management, law and economics between 2013 and 2018. Based on this broad basis, the authors find that: research on Airbnb is highly diverse in terms of domains, methods and scope; motives for using Airbnb are manifold (e.g. financial, social and environmental); trust and reputation are considered crucial by almost all scholars; the platform’s variety is reflected in prices; and the majority of work is based on surveys and empirical data while experiments are scarce.Practical implicationsBased on the present assessment of studied topics, domains, methods and combinations thereof, the authors suggest that research should move toward building atop of a common ground of data structures and vocabulary, and that attention should focus on the identified gaps and hitherto scarcely used combinations. The set of under-represented areas includes cross-cultural investigations, field experiments and audit studies, the consideration of dynamic processes (e.g. based on panel data), Airbnb’s “experiences” and automated pricing algorithms and the rating distribution’s skewness.Originality/valueThis study provides a comprehensive overview of work on the accommodation sharing platform Airbnb, to the best of the auhtors’ knowledge, representing the first systematic literature review. The authors hope that researchers and practitioners alike will find this review useful as a reference for future research on Airbnb and as a guide for the development of innovative applications based on the platform’s peculiarities and paradigms in electronic commerce practice. From a practical perspective, the general tenor suggests that hotel and tourism operators may benefit from: focusing on their core advantages over Airbnb and differentiating features and aligning their marketing communication with their users’ aspirations.",10.1108/IJCHM-03-2018-0186
