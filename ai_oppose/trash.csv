"Human intelligence is a puzzling concept. There is no consensus on the definition of intelligence, not even within specific fields that study intelligence, such as psychometrics. Within the latter, there are, for instance, major disputes over whether intelligence is one thing (a general ability) or multiple things. In our view, it is important to have a clear conception of what intelligence is. In this chapter we adhere to such a conception and present a formal model of psychometric intelligence.

"We propose a theory of development in which experience is directed by genotypes. Genotypic differences are proposed to affect phenotypic differences, both directly and through experience, via 3 kinds of genotype leads to environment effects: a passive kind, through environments provided by biologically related parents; an evocative kind, through responses elicited by individuals from others; and an active kind, through the selection of different environments by different people. The theory adapts the 3 kinds of genotype-environment correlations proposed by Plomin, DeFries, and Loehlin in a developmental model that is used to explain results from studies of deprivation, intervention, twins, and families.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,How people make their own environments: a theory of genotype greater than environment effects.,1983,"s. scarr, k. mccartney,",
"This paper serves to update the structure-of-intellect (SOI) model. In addition to a previously indicated separation of the figural element of the content facet of the SOI model into visual and auditory components, the memory element within the operations facet has been differentiated into memory recording and memory retention. Research supporting these changes is cited. Thus the revised SOI model now contains five content properties termed visual, auditory, symbolic, semantic, and behavioral; six operations entitled cognition, memory recording, memory retention, divergent production, convergent production, and evaluation; and the same six products as formerly, named units, classes, relations, systems, transformations, and implications.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Some Changes in the Structure-of-Intellect Model,1988,"j. guilford,",

"Some argue that the high heritability of IQ renders purely environmental explanations for large IQ differences between groups implausible. Yet, large environmentally induced IQ gains between generations suggest an important role for environment in shaping IQ. The authors present a formal model of the process determining IQ in which people's IQs are affected by both environment and genes, but in which their environments are matched to their IQs. The authors show how such a model allows very large effects for environment, even incorporating the highest estimates of heritability. Besides resolving the paradox, the authors show that the model can account for a number of other phenomena, some of which are anomalous when viewed from the standard perspective.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: the IQ paradox resolved.,2001,"w. dickens, j. flynn,",
"Psychology is focused on variation between cases (interindividual variation). Results thus obtained are considered to be generalizable to the understanding and explanation of variation within single cases (intraindividual variation). It is indicated, however, that the direct consequences of the classical ergodic theorems for psychology and psychometrics invalidate this conjectured generalizability: only under very strict conditions-which are hardly obtained in real psychological processes-can a generalization be made from a structure of interindividual variation to the analogous structure of intraindividual variation. Illustrations of the lack of this generalizability are given in the contexts of psychometrics, developmental psychology, and personality theory.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,"A Manifesto on Psychology as Idiographic Science: Bringing the Person Back Into Scientific Psychology, This Time Forever",2004,"p. molenaar,",
"For more than a century, the standard view in the field of human intelligence has been that there is a “general intelligence” that permeates all human cognitive activity. This general cognitive ability is supposed to explain the positive manifold, the finding that intelligence tests with different content all correlate. Yet there is a lack of consensus regarding the psychological or neural basis of such an ability. A recent account, process-overlap theory, explains the positive manifold without proposing general intelligence. As a consequence of the theory, IQ is redefined as an emergent formative construct rather than a reflective latent trait. This implies that IQ should be interpreted as an index of specific cognitive abilities rather than the reflection of an underlying general cognitive ability.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,What Is IQ?

"Learning is often considered complete when a student can produce the correct answer to a question. In our research, students in one condition learned foreign language vocabulary words in the standard paradigm of repeated study-test trials. In three other conditions, once a student had correctly produced the vocabulary item, it was repeatedly studied but dropped from further testing, repeatedly tested but dropped from further study, or dropped from both study and test. Repeated studying after learning had no effect on delayed recall, but repeated testing produced a large positive effect. In addition, students' predictions of their performance were uncorrelated with actual performance. The results demonstrate the critical role of retrieval practice in consolidating learning and show that even university students seem unaware of this fact.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning,2008,"jeffrey d. karpicke, h. roediger,",
"The indeterminacy of factor scores has been a perennial source of debate since the time of Spearman. The main purpose of this paper is to show that, in spite of his inadequate tools and concepts, Sir Godfrey Thomson's approach of 70 years ago was on the right lines. His thinking was constrained by the primitive state of his statistical understanding but it is illuminated by his substantial exchange of the correspondence with M. S. Bartlett in the 1930s, most of which has survived in the Godfrey Thomson archive at the University of Edinburgh. In order to justify our claim and clarify the issues, we have found it necessary to fill in some of the gaps in the original derivations of Spearman, Thomson and Bartlett and to express their work in terms which are intelligible today. The opportunity is taken to relate this earlier work to contemporary debates.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,"The origin of factor scores: Spearman, Thomson and Bartlett.",2009,"d. bartholomew, i. deary, m. lawn,",
"In their original article (W. T. Dickens & J. R. Flynn, 2001), the authors formalized the consensus model of reciprocal effects between IQ and environment and showed that it can resolve the apparent paradox between high heritability and large environmental effects. Commentators suggested that the model has undesirable properties that call its usefulness into question. J. L. Loehlin (2002) argued that incorporating persistence of IQ into the model causes problematic behavior. D. C. Rowe and J. L. Rodgers (2002) argued that an increasing correlation of IQ and environment should have caused growing variance of IQ. Empirical evidence suggests that IQ is not sufficiently persistent to cause the problems Loehlin found and that the correlation of IQ and environment has not grown much over time so that the reciprocal effects model need not imply increasing variance.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The IQ paradox is still resolved: Reply to Loehlin (2002) and Rowe and Rodgers (2002),2002,"w. dickens, j. flynn,",
"In the last decade, new models of human intelligence have altered the theoretical landscape in psychometrics and cognitive science. In the current article, we provide an overview of key distinguishing features of these new models. Compared to 20th century models of intelligence, the new models proposed in the 21st century are unique for three primary reasons; (1) new models interpret the general factor, or g, as an emergent property reflecting the pattern of positive correlations observed among test scores, not as a causal latent variable, and therefore challenge the notion of general ability, (2) new models bridge correlational and experimental psychology and account for inter-individual differences in behavior in terms of intra-individual psychological processes, and (3) new models make novel predictions about the neural correlates of intelligent behavior.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,New and emerging models of human intelligence.,2015,"andrew r. a. conway, kristóf kovács,",
"The Curie–Weiss model is an exactly solvable model of ferromagnetism that allows one to study thermodynamic functions in detail, in particular their properties near the critical temperature. In this model every magnetic moment interacts with every other magnetic moment. Because of its simplicity and the correctness of at least some of its predictions, the Curie–Weiss model occupies an important place in the statistical mechanics literature and its application to information theory. It is frequently presented as an introduction to the Ising model or to spin-glass models, and usually only general features of the Curie–Weiss model are presented. In this paper, we discuss the properties of this model in a rather detailed way. We present the exact, approximate and numerical results for this particular model.

Tests of this hypothesis have produced apparently inconsistent results.

In U.S. studies, we found clear support for moderately sized Gene × SES effects.

"Twentieth century theory formation in human intelligence was dominated by factor theories; network theories will dominate the twenty first. Network theories answer a broad call for formal theories in psychological science, provide a strong approach to an idiographic science, and create an opportunity to study the developmental mechanisms of human's cognitive dynamics. Although the current century already delivered two formal stationary network theories of human intelligence—mutualism and wired intelligence—integrating dynamic mechanisms remains a serious challenge. This challenge translates into clear priorities: the identification of robust developmental phenomena, the study of the mechanisms that drive these phenomena, the integration of these mechanisms into network theories of growth, the integration of network theories from different explanatory levels, and the empirical characterization of the structure of network theories.",10.31234/osf.io/shq87,Evolving Networks of Human Intelligence,2021.0,a. o. savi m. marsman h. v. d. van der maas,
"Cognitive development can be characterized by a sequence of increasingly complex rules or strategies for solving problems. Our work focuses on the development of children's proportional reasoning, assessed by the balance scale task using Siegler's (1976, 1981) rule assessment methodology. We studied whether children use rules, whether children of different ages use qualitatively different rules, and whether rules are used consistently. Nonverbal balance scale problems were administered to 805 participants between 5 and 19 years of age. Latent class analyses indicate that children use rules, that children of different ages use different rules, and that both consistent and inconsistent use of rules occurs. A model for the development of reasoning about the balance scale task is proposed. The model is a restricted form of the overlapping waves model (Siegler, 1996) and predicts both discontinuous and gradual transitions between rules.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The development of children's rule use on the balance scale task.,2002,"brenda r. j. jansen, h.l.j. van der maas,",
"The Matthew effect hypothesis provides a theoretical framework to describe the development of individual differences in reading ability. The model predicts an increase of individual differences in reading. Reciprocal relationships between reading and other factors seem to cause these increasing differences. This longitudinal study of 3 years was concerned with uncovering the existence and causes of increasing individual differences in reading in the early elementary grades. Data were analyzed within a structural equation modeling framework. The results clearly indicate increasing individual differences for word recognition skills. For reading comprehension, no such effects could be established for this limited time period. More important, some evidence for interactive relationships between reading and other cognitive skills, behaviors, and motivational factors, hypothesized to cause increasing differences between readers, was found.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Analyzing the development of individual differences in terms of Matthew effects in reading: results from a Dutch Longitudinal study.,1998,"j. bast, p. reitsma,",
"The positive manifold of intelligence has fascinated generations of scholars in human ability. In the past century, various formal explanations have been proposed, including the dominant g factor, the revived sampling theory, and the recent multiplier effect model and mutualism model. In this article, we propose a novel idiographic explanation. We formally conceptualize intelligence as evolving networks in which new facts and procedures are wired together during development. The static model, an extension of the Fortuin–Kasteleyn model, provides a parsimonious explanation of the positive manifold and intelligence’s hierarchical factor structure. We show how it can explain the Matthew effect across developmental stages. Finally, we introduce a method for studying growth dynamics. Our truly idiographic approach offers a new view on a century-old construct and ultimately allows the fields of human ability and human learning to coalesce.",10.1177/1745691619866447,The Wiring of Intelligence,2018.0,a. o. savi m. marsman h. v. d. van der maas g. maris,
"We present the qgraph package for R, which provides an interface to visualize data through network modeling techniques. For instance, a correlation matrix can be represented as a network in which each variable is a node and each correlation an edge; by varying the width of the edges according to the magnitude of the correlation, the structure of the correlation matrix can be visualized. A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results.

"ABSTRACT The most replicated result in the field of intelligence is the positive manifold, which refers to an all-positive pattern of correlations among diverse cognitive tests. The positive manifold is typically described by a general factor, or g. In turn, g is often identified as general intelligence, yet this explanation is contradicted by a number of results. Here we offer a new account of g: process overlap theory. According to the theory, cognitive tests tap domain-general executive processes, identified primarily in research on working memory, as well as more domain-specific processes. Executive processes are tapped in an overlapping manner across cognitive tests such that they are required more often than domain-specific ones. The theory provides an account of a number of findings on human intelligence. As well, it is formalized as a multidimensional item response model and as a structural model, and the neural mechanisms underlying the proposed overlapping processes are discussed.",10.1080/1047840X.2016.1153946,Process Overlap Theory: A Unified Account of the General Factor of Intelligence,2016.0,kristóf kovács andrew r. a. conway,

Cattell's (1971, 1987) investment hypothesis were evaluated using linear dynamic models applied to longitudinal data (N=672). Contrary to Cattell's hypothesis, a first set of findings indicated that fluid and crystallized abilities, as defined by the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R; R. W. Woodcock & M. B. Johnson, 1989-1990), were not dynamically coupled with each other over time. A second set of findings provided support for the original predictions and indicated that fluid ability was a leading indicator of changes in achievement measures (i.e., quantitative ability and general academic knowledge). The findings of this study suggest that the dynamics of cognitive abilities and academic achievement follow a more complex pattern than that specified by Cattell's investment hypothesis.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,An experimental analysis of dynamic hypotheses about cognitive abilities and achievement from childhood to early adulthood.,2004,"e. ferrer, j. mcardle,",
"Cronbach’s (1957) famous division of scientific psychology into two disciplines is still apparent for the fields of cognition (general mechanisms) and intelligence (dimensionality of individual differences). The welcome integration of the two fields requires the construction of mechanistic models of cognition and cognitive development that explain key phenomena in individual differences research. In this paper, we argue that network modeling is a promising approach to integrate the processes of cognitive development and (developing) intelligence into one unified theory. Network models are defined mathematically, describe mechanisms on the level of the individual, and are able to explain positive correlations among intelligence subtest scores—the empirical basis for the well-known g-factor—as well as more complex factorial structures. Links between network modeling, factor modeling, and item response theory allow for a common metric, encompassing both discrete and continuous characteristics, for cognitive development and intelligence.",10.3390/JINTELLIGENCE5020016,Network Models for Cognitive Development and Intelligence,2017.0,h.l.j. van der maas k. kan m. marsman c. stevenson,
"Scores on cognitive tasks used in intelligence tests correlate positively with each other, that is, they display a positive manifold of correlations. The positive manifold is often explained by positing a dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,A dynamical model of general intelligence: the positive manifold of intelligence by mutualism.,2006,"h.l.j. van der maas, c. dolan, r. grasman, j. wicherts, h. huizenga, m. raijmakers,",

"The Flynn effect (rising intelligence test performance in the general population over time and generations) varies enigmatically across countries and intelligence domains; its substantive meaning and causes remain elusive. This first formal meta-analysis on the topic revealed worldwide IQ gains across more than one century (1909–2013), based on 271 independent samples, totaling almost 4 million participants, from 31 countries. Key findings include that IQ gains vary according to domain (estimated 0.41, 0.30, 0.28, and 0.21 IQ points annually for fluid, spatial, full-scale, and crystallized IQ test performance, respectively), are stronger for adults than children, and have decreased in more recent decades. Altogether, these findings narrow down proposed theories and candidate factors presumably accounting for the Flynn effect. Factors associated with life history speed seem mainly responsible for the Flynn effect’s general trajectory, whereas favorable social multiplier effects and effects related to economic prosperity appear to be responsible for observed differences of the Flynn effect across intelligence domains.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,One Century of Global IQ Gains,2015,"j. pietschnig, m. voracek,",
"For many probability distributions of interest, it is quite difficult to obtain samples efficiently. Often, Markov chains are employed to obtain approximately random samples from these distributions. The primary drawback to traditional Markov chain methods is that the mixing time of the chain is usually unknown, which makes it impossible to determine how close the output samples are to having the target distribution. The authors present a novel protocol, the randomness recycler (RR), that overcomes this difficulty. Unlike classical Markov chain approaches, an RR-based algorithm creates samples drawn exactly from the desired distribution. Other perfect sampling methods such as coupling from the past, use existing Markov chains, but RR does not use the traditional Markov chain at all. While by no means universally useful, RR does apply to a wide variety of problems. In restricted instances of certain problems, it gives the first expected linear time algorithms for generating samples. The authors apply RR to self-organizing lists, the Ising model, random independent sets, random colorings, and the random cluster model.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The randomness recycler: a new technique for perfect sampling,2000,"j. a. fill, m. huber,",

We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa.

"Modern factor analysis is the outgrowth of Spearman's original ""2-factor"" model of intelligence, according to which a mental test score is regarded as the sum of a general factor and a specific factor. As early as 1914, Godfrey Thomson realized that the data did not require this interpretation and he demonstrated this by proposing what became known as his ""bonds"" model of intelligence. Van der Maas et al. (2006) have recently drawn attention to what they perceive as difficulties with both models and have proposed a 3rd model. Neither alternative requires the general factor that was at the core of Spearman's idea. Although Thomson's model has been largely forgotten, the authors show that it merits further consideration because it can compete, statistically and biologically, on equal terms with Spearman's model. In particular, they show that it is impossible to distinguish statistically between the 2 models. There are also lessons to be learnt from the way in which Thomson arrived at his model and from the subsequent debate between Spearman and Thomson. The extent to which the recent proposal by van der Maas et al. may offer any advantage over Spearman's and Thomson's models is unclear and requires further investigation.",10.1037/a0016262,A new lease of life for Thomson's bonds model of intelligence.,2009.0,d. bartholomew i. deary m. lawn,
"Raymond B. Cattell is credited with the development of the theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence. The genesis of this theory is, however, vague. Cattell, in different papers, stated that it was developed in 1940, 1941 or 1942. Carroll (1984, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 19, 300-306) noted the similarity of Cattell's theory to “Hebb's notion of two types of intelligence,” which was presented at the 1941 APA meeting, but the matter has been left at that. Correspondence between Cattell, Donald Hebb and George Humphrey of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, however, indicates that Cattell adopted Hebb's ideas of intelligence A and B and renamed them. This paper describes Hebb's two types of intelligence, and shows how Cattell used them to develop his ideas of crystallized and fluid intelligence. Hebb and Cattell exchanged a number of letters before Cattell's paper was rewritten in such a way that everyone was satisfied. This paper examines the work of Hebb and Cattell on intelligence, their correspondence, the development of the ideas of fluid and crystallized intelligence, and why Cattell (1943, p. 179) wrote that “Hebb has independently stated very clearly what constitutes two thirds of the present theory.”",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Hebb and Cattell: The Genesis of the Theory of Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence,2016,"richard e. brown,",
"The Matthew effect describes the phenomenon that in societies, the rich tend to get richer and the potent even more powerful. It is closely related to the concept of preferential attachment in network science, where the more connected nodes are destined to acquire many more links in the future than the auxiliary nodes. Cumulative advantage and success-breads-success also both describe the fact that advantage tends to beget further advantage. The concept is behind the many power laws and scaling behaviour in empirical data, and it is at the heart of self-organization across social and natural sciences. Here, we review the methodology for measuring preferential attachment in empirical data, as well as the observations of the Matthew effect in patterns of scientific collaboration, socio-technical and biological networks, the propagation of citations, the emergence of scientific progress and impact, career longevity, the evolution of common English words and phrases, as well as in education and brain development.

"ABSTRACT In recent years, network models have been proposed as an alternative representation of psychometric constructs such as depression. In such models, the covariance between observables (e.g., symptoms like depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt) is explained in terms of a pattern of causal interactions between these observables, which contrasts with classical interpretations in which the observables are conceptualized as the effects of a reflective latent variable. However, few investigations have been directed at the question how these different models relate to each other. To shed light on this issue, the current paper explores the relation between one of the most important network models—the Ising model from physics—and one of the most important latent variable models—the Item Response Theory (IRT) model from psychometrics. The Ising model describes the interaction between states of particles that are connected in a network, whereas the IRT model describes the probability distribution associated with item responses in a psychometric test as a function of a latent variable. Despite the divergent backgrounds of the models, we show a broad equivalence between them and also illustrate several opportunities that arise from this connection.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,An Introduction to Network Psychometrics: Relating Ising Network Models to Item Response Theory Models,2018,"m. marsman, d. borsboom, j. kruis, s. epskamp, r. van bork, l. waldorp, h.l.j. van der maas, g. maris,",
"Abstract The pivotal problem of comorbidity research lies in the psychometric foundation it rests on, that is, latent variable theory, in which a mental disorder is viewed as a latent variable that causes a constellation of symptoms. From this perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.",10.1017/S0140525X09991567,Comorbidity: A network perspective,2010.0,a. cramer l. waldorp h.l.j. van der maas d. borsboom,
"Abstract Networks are gaining popularity as an alternative to latent variable models for representing psychological constructs. Whereas latent variable approaches introduce unobserved common causes to explain the relations among observed variables, network approaches posit direct causal relations between observed variables. While these approaches lead to radically different understandings of the psychological constructs of interest, recent articles have established mathematical equivalences that hold between network models and latent variable models. We argue that the fact that for any model from one class there is an equivalent model from the other class does not mean that both models are equally plausible accounts of the data-generating mechanism. In many cases the constraints that are meaningful in one framework translate to constraints in the equivalent model that lack a clear interpretation in the other framework. Finally, we discuss three diverging predictions for the relation between zero-order correlations and partial correlations implied by sparse network models and unidimensional factor models. We propose a test procedure that compares the likelihoods of these models in light of these diverging implications.

Results support the primary broad abilities from the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory and suggest that the working memory–attentional control complex may be central to understanding a CHC network model of intelligence.

With this history in place, more recent attempts to distinguish between different concepts of G × E are considered, paying particular attention to the commonly made distinction between “statistical interaction” and “interactionism,” and Michael Rutter's distinction between statistical interaction and “the biological concept of interaction.” I argue that the history of the separate legacies of G × EB and G × ED better supports Rutter's analysis of the situation and that this analysis best paves the way for an integrative relationship between the various scientists investigating the place of G × E in the etiology of complex traits.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,"Biometric and developmental gene–environment interactions: Looking back, moving forward",2007,"james tabery,",
"We present a review of empirical evidence that suggests that a substantial portion of phenotypic variance is due to nonlinear (epigenetic) processes during ontogenesis. The role of such processes as a source of phenotypic variance in human behaviour genetic studies is not fully appreciated. In addition to our review, we present simulation studies of nonlinear epigenetic variance using a computational model of neuronal network development. In each simulation study, time series for monozygotic and dizygotic twins were generated and analysed using conventional behaviour genetic modelling. In the results of these analyses, the nonlinear epigenetic variance was subsumed under the non-shared environmental component. As is commonly found in behaviour genetic studies, observed heritabilities and unique environmentabilities increased with time, whereas common environmentabilities decreased. The fact that the phenotypic effects of nonlinear epigenetic processes appear as unsystematic variance in conventional twin analyses complicates the identification and quantification of the ultimate genetic and environmental causes of individual differences. We believe that nonlinear dynamical system theories provide a challenging perspective on the development of individual differences, which may enrich behaviour genetic studies.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Nonlinear epigenetic variance: review and simulations.,2010,"k. kan, a. ploeger, m. raijmakers, c. dolan, h.l.j. van der maas,",
"Understanding both typical human development and indivdual differences within the same theoretical framework has been difficult because the 2 orientations arise from different philosophical traditions. It is argued that an evolutionary perspective can unite the study of both species-typical development and individual variation. Research on determininants of development from many perspectives can be understood within an evolutionary framework in which organism and environment combine to produce development. Species-normal genes and environments and indidividual variations in genes and environments both affect personality, social, and intellectual development. These domains are used as examples to integrate theories of normal development and individual differences. Within the usual samples of European, North American, and developed Asian countries, the results of family and twin studies show that environments within the normal species range are crucial to normal development. Given a wide range of environmental opportunities and emotional supports, however, most children in these societies grow up to be individually different based on their individual genotypes.

"Abstract The Ising model is a graphical model that has played an essential role in network psychometrics. It has been used as a theoretical model to conceptualize psychological concepts and as a statistical model to analyze psychological data. Using graphical models such as the Ising model to analyze psychological data has been heavily critiqued since these data often come from cross-sectional applications. An often voiced concern is the inability of the Ising model to express heterogeneity in the population. The idiographic approach has been posed as an alternative and aims to infer individual network structures. While idiographic networks overcome population heterogeneity, it is unclear how they aggregate into established cross-sectional phenomena. This paper establishes a formal bridge between idiographic and cross-sectional network approaches of the Ising model. We ascertain unique topological structures that characterize individuals and aggregate into an Ising model cross-sectionally. This new formulation supports population heterogeneity while being consistent with cross-sectional phenomena. The proposed theory also establishes a new statistical framework for analyzing populations of idiographic networks for binary variables. The Ising model and the divide and color model are special cases of this new framework. We introduce a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate models from this new framework.",10.1080/00273171.2022.2135089,Idiographic Ising and Divide and Color Models: Encompassing Networks for Heterogeneous Binary Data,2019.0,m. marsman k. huth,

"Intelligence can have an extremely high heritability, but also be malleable; a paradox that has been the source of continuous controversy. Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and advance a frequently overlooked solution to the paradox: Intelligence is a trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of hidden gene–environment (GE) networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of “genetic” effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in intelligence, with malleability existing on top of heritability. The evidence covers cognitive gains consequent to adoption/immigration, changes in IQ’s heritability across life span and socioeconomic status, gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive decline, and the gains in intelligence from early education. The GE solution has novel implications for enduring problems, including our inability to identify intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ’s “missing heritability”), and the loss of initial benefits from early intervention programs (such as “Head Start”). The GE solution can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in impoverished and underprivileged populations.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The Paradox of Intelligence: Heritability and Malleability Coexist in Hidden Gene-Environment Interplay,2018,"b. sauce, l. matzel,",
"In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self‐sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,A network theory of mental disorders,2017,"d. borsboom,",

Our means of making this reconciliation is to describe recent efforts by diverse scholars to explain cognitive growth in terms of theories, models, and metaphors that are inherently multiplicative, more so than prior ones. We do not intend to delve into a comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each model or metaphor, as that is not our goal, but instead we want to make the point that various researchers, coming from very different orientations, have found the need to postulate similar types of multiplier effects to account for cognitive growth across a wide range of attainments (reading, intelligence, mathematics, motoric).

The proposal integrates research on intelligence with models of the centrality of mitochondria to brain development and functioning, neurological diseases, and health more generally. Moreover, the combination of the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the evolution of compensatory nuclear DNA, and the inability of evolutionary processes to purge deleterious mtDNA in males may contribute to the sex difference in variability in intelligence and in other cognitive domains.

"This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry.

However, there are marked individual differences in rates of cognitive decline, with some adults declining steeply and others maintaining high levels of functioning. To move toward a comprehensive understanding of cognitive aging, it is critical to know whether individual differences in longitudinal changes interrelate across different cognitive abilities. We identified 89 effect sizes representing shared variance in longitudinal cognitive change from 22 unique datasets composed of more than 30,000 unique individuals, which we meta-analyzed using a series of multilevel metaregression models. An average of 60% of the variation in cognitive changes was shared across cognitive abilities. Shared variation in changes increased with age, from approximately 45% at age 35 years to approximately 70% at age 85 years. There was a moderate-to-strong correspondence (r = .49, congruence coefficient = .98) between the extent to which a variable indicated general intelligence and the extent to which change in that variable indicated a general factor of aging-related change. Shared variation in changes did not differ substantially across cognitive ability domain classifications. In a sensitivity analysis based on studies that carefully controlled for dementia, shared variation in longitudinal cognitive changes remained at upward of 60%, and age-related increases in shared variation in cognitive changes continued to be evident. These results together provide strong evidence for a general factor of cognitive aging that strengthens with advancing adult age.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Coupled Cognitive Changes in Adulthood: A Meta-Analysis,2019,"e. tucker-drob, a. brandmaier, u. lindenberger,",
"This study aimed to determine the relations between fluid intelligence (Gf) and reading/mathematics and possible moderators. A meta-analysis of 680 studies involving 793 independent samples and more than 370,000 participants found that Gf was moderately related to reading, r = .38, 95% CI [.36, .39], and mathematics, r = .41, 95% CI [.39, 44]. Synthesis on the longitudinal correlations showed that Gf and reading/mathematics predicted each other in the development even after controlling for initial performance. Moderation analyses revealed the following findings: (a) Gf showed stronger relations to mathematics than to reading, (b) within reading or mathematics, Gf showed stronger relations to complex skills than to foundational skills, (c) the relations between Gf and reading/mathematics increased with age, and (d) family social economic status (SES) mostly affected the relations between Gf and reading/mathematics in the early development stage. These findings, taken together, are partially in line with the investment theory but are more in line with the intrinsic cognitive load theory, mutualism theory, and the gene–SES interaction hypothesis of cognition and learning. More importantly, these findings imply an integration model of these theories from an educational and developmental perspective: Children may rely on Gf to learn reading and mathematics early on, when high family SES can boost the effects of Gf on reading/mathematics performance. As children receive more formal schooling and gain more learning experiences, their reading and mathematics improvement may promote their Gf development. During development, the negative effects of low family SES on the relations between Gf and reading/mathematics may be offset by education/learning experiences.",10.1037/bul0000182,"A Meta-Analysis on the Relation Between Fluid Intelligence and Reading/Mathematics: Effects of Tasks, Age, and Social Economics Status",2019.0,peng peng tengfei wang cuicui wang xin lin,
"NO man can be acquainted with all of psychology today, as our convention program proves. The scene resembles that of a circus, but a circus grander and more bustling than any Barnum ever envisioned—a veritable week-long diet of excitement and pink lemonade. Three days of smartly paced performance are required just to display the new tricks the animal trainers have taught their charges. We admire the agile paperreaders swinging high above us in the theoretical blue, saved from disaster by only a few gossamer threads of fact, and we gasp as one symposiast thrusts his head bravely between another's sharp toothed jaws. This 18-ring display of energies and talents gives plentiful evidence that psychology is going places. But whither? In the simpler days of psychology, the presidential address provided a summing-up and a statement of destination. The President called the roll of the branches of psychology—praising the growth of some youngsters, tut-tutting patriarchally over the delinquent tendencies of others—and showed each to his proper place at the family table. My own title is reminiscent of those grand surveys, but the last speaker who could securely bring the whole of psychology within one perspective was Dashiell, with his 1938 address on ""Rapprochements in Contemporary Psychology"" (15). My scope must be far more restricted. I shall discuss the past and future place within psychology of two historic streams of method, thought, and affiliation which run through the last century of our science. One stream is experimental psychology; the other, correlational psychology. Dashiell optimistically forecast a confluence of these two streams, but that confluence is still in the making. Psychology continues to this day to be limited by the dedication of its investigators to one or the other method of inquiry rather than to scientific psychology as a whole.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The two disciplines of scientific psychology.,1957,"l. cronbach,",
"Significance Why do scientists with similar backgrounds and abilities often end up achieving very different degrees of success? A classic explanation is that academic achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Early successes increase future success chances. We analyze data from a large academic funding program that present a unique opportunity to quantify the Matthew effect and identify generative mechanisms. Our results show that winners just above the funding threshold accumulate more than twice as much funding during the subsequent eight years as nonwinners with near-identical review scores that fall just below the threshold. This effect is partly caused by nonwinners ceasing to compete for other funding opportunities, revealing a “participation” mechanism driving the Matthew effect. A classic thesis is that scientific achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to succeed again, producing increasing distinction. We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a €2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (€180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners’ improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding. Surprisingly, however, the emergent funding gap is partly created by applicants, who, after failing to win one grant, apply for another grant less often.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The Matthew effect in science funding,2018,"t. bol, mathijs de vaan, a. van de rijt,",
"Background and Objectives In the proposed symptom network approach to psychopathology, psychiatric disorders are assumed to result from the (causal) interplay between symptoms. By implementing this approach we explored whether individual feedback on symptom dynamics complements current categorical classification and treatment. The aim of this proof-of-principle case-study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability and usability of this transdiagnostic approach. Methods A female patient, aged 67, suffering from treatment resistant anxious and depressive symptoms was treated in our tertiary outpatient clinic for old age psychiatry. She participated in ecological momentary assessments (EMA), which involved intensive repeated measurements of mood and context-related items during two weeks. Visualizations of the interplay between the items were provided by network graphs and were discussed with the patient. Results Network graphs were discussed with the patient. For example, it was hypothesized and discussed with the patient that feeling relaxed increased physical activity, causing physical discomfort in the following hours. Physical discomfort caused stress as its symptoms resembled her feared somatic anxiety symptoms. This increased the patient’s insight that stress, expressed as somatic symptoms, played a central role in her panic disorder. This started a dialogue on how to cope with stress caused by somatic (anxiety) symptoms and provided a rationale for the patient to start an interoceptive exposure intervention she had repeatedly refused before. Limitations The observed symptom dynamics may not be generalizable to any other random two weeks. Conclusions Personalized diagnosis of psychopathology incorporating complex symptom dynamics is feasible and a promising addition to current categorical diagnostic systems and could guide intervention selection. This merits further exploration.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Personalized Feedback on Symptom Dynamics of Psychopathology: A Proof-of-Principle Study,2017,"r. kroeze, d. c. van der veen, m. servaas, j. bastiaansen, r. o. oude voshaar, d. borsboom, h. ruhé, r. schoevers, h. riese,",
"Abstract “Is there a biology of intelligence which is characteristic of the normal human nervous system?” Here we review 37 modern neuroimaging studies in an attempt to address this question posed by Halstead (1947) as he and other icons of the last century endeavored to understand how brain and behavior are linked through the expression of intelligence and reason. Reviewing studies from functional (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) and structural (i.e., magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, voxel-based morphometry) neuroimaging paradigms, we report a striking consensus suggesting that variations in a distributed network predict individual differences found on intelligence and reasoning tasks. We describe this network as the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). The P-FIT model includes, by Brodmann areas (BAs): the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BAs 6, 9, 10, 45, 46, 47), the inferior (BAs 39, 40) and superior (BA 7) parietal lobule, the anterior cingulate (BA 32), and regions within the temporal (BAs 21, 37) and occipital (BAs 18, 19) lobes. White matter regions (i.e., arcuate fasciculus) are also implicated. The P-FIT is examined in light of findings from human lesion studies, including missile wounds, frontal lobotomy/leukotomy, temporal lobectomy, and lesions resulting in damage to the language network (e.g., aphasia), as well as findings from imaging research identifying brain regions under significant genetic control. Overall, we conclude that modern neuroimaging techniques are beginning to articulate a biology of intelligence. We propose that the P-FIT provides a parsimonious account for many of the empirical observations, to date, which relate individual differences in intelligence test scores to variations in brain structure and function. Moreover, the model provides a framework for testing new hypotheses in future experimental designs.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,The Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT) of intelligence: Converging neuroimaging evidence,2007,"r. jung, r. haier,",
"The acquisition and retention of conceptual knowledge is more effective in well-structured curricula that provide an optimal conceptual framework for learning new material. However, the neural mechanisms by which preexisting conceptual schemas facilitate learning are not yet well understood despite their fundamental importance. A preexisting schema has been shown to enhance memory by influencing the balance between activity within the medial-temporal lobe and the medial pFC during mnemonic processes such as encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Specifically, correctly encoding and retrieving information that is related to preexisting schemas appears rather related to medial prefrontal processing, whereas information unrelated or inconsistent with preexisting schemas rather relates to enhanced medial temporal processing and enhanced interaction between these structures. To further investigate interactions between these regions during conceptual encoding in a real-world university setting, we probed human brain activity and connectivity using fMRI during educationally relevant conceptual encoding carefully embedded within two course programs. Early second-year undergraduate biology and education students were scanned while encoding new facts that were either related or unrelated to the preexisting conceptual knowledge they had acquired during their first year of study. Subsequently, they were tested on their knowledge of these facts 24 hr later. Memory scores were better for course-related information, and this enhancement was associated with larger medial-prefrontal, but smaller medial-temporal subsequent memory effects. These activity differences went along with decreased functional interactions between these regions. Furthermore, schema-related medial-prefrontal subsequent memory effects measured during this experiment were found to be predictive of second-year course performance. These results, obtained in a real-world university setting, reveal brain mechanisms underlying acquisition of new knowledge that can be integrated into preexisting conceptual schemas and may indicate how relevant this process is for study success.",data/intelligence_addon.pdf,Building on Prior Knowledge: Schema-dependent Encoding Processes Relate to Academic Performance,2014,"m. v. kesteren, m. rijpkema, d. ruiter, r. morris, g. fernández,",

"Investigations of the role of competition, predation and abiotic stress in shaping natural communities were a staple for previous generations of ecologists and are still popular themes. However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms. But, ultimately, revising ecological theory will lead to a more accurate and inclusive understanding of natural communities.",data/mutualism.pdf,Inclusion of facilitation into ecological theory,2003,j. bruno j. stachowicz m. bertness,0.0

"Structural approaches to development, such as Piaget's stage theory, have proved to be problematic in dealing with developmental transitions. More promising in this respect are models of qualitative change that address macroscopical phase shifts in non‐linear dynamical systems that arise from quantitative changes at the microscopical level. In this introductory paper, we attempt to clarify the meanings of some of the core terms used in these models so as to set the scene for the subsequent contributions. We stress the relevance of recent advances in catastrophe theory for detecting developmental transitions and suggest that the concept of self‐organization as formulated in irreversible thermodynamics provides a framework for explaining them. As yet, there is a lack of convincing evidence that transitions of interest to developmental psychologists comply with principles of self‐organization that have become well established for time‐evolving systems in other disciplines such as chemistry and biology. Demonstrations of self‐organization in psychologically relevant simulation models are a first step in attaining such evidence. In this special issue, we concentrate primarily on a common approach to the detection of transitions across a number of domains of development. However, in doing so illustrations are given of the ways in which the hypothesis of self‐organization can be used to account for the mechanisms of developmental transitions.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.studeersnel.nl/nl/document/universiteit-utrecht/culture-and-development/hoofdstuk-5-developmental-transitions/1166266,Developmental transitions,1998,"H.

"The notion of development plays an important role in cultural, political and personal discourse. For instance, in the newspaper, we read about the problems of developing countries. At another level, personal development is considered an important issue and people spend considerable effort in promoting their development and that of others for whom they have responsibility. The notion of development has subtle and diverse meanings, which are reasonably adequately covered by everyday language. Scientific discourse about development as such, apart from the technical aspects of applying it to one or other specific domain of inquiry, is not much better developed, if at all, than its everyday counterpart. It might be interesting, therefore, to look at the intuitive meaning of the notion of development, in an attempt to uncover aspects that might be worth considering in more formal, scientific approaches.

"This chapter highlights the central conceptual issues associated with evaluating the relationship between education and intelligence. The notion that intelligence influences educational success has been taken as a given among most theorists and researchers over the past century. The corpus of data suggests that both propositions are likely to be true to one degree or another, especially in terms of IQ test scores. The verisimilitude of these propositions, though, is most clearly demonstrated at the margins. Thus, individuals with very low measured intelligence are most highly likely to fail in mainstream educational assignments. Similarly, the complete absence of schooling appears highly likely to lead to very low measured intelligence. In between, the effects of intelligence on educational success and the effects of schooling on intelligence become attenuated. It is clear, however, that measured intelligence is not fixed and constant. It appears that the effects of education on intelligence tend to be more marked with younger children than with adults. The factors that influence change in intelligence may be general, or they may be multifaceted, such as involving constellations of traits that are mutually supportive or impeding for intellectual development.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://hackscience.education/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ackerman_CV_202205.pdf,Education and g,2003,"Ackerman, P.

"The lower average correlations among mental tests in groups of individuals of above-average IQ compared to those found in groups of individuals of below-average IQ implies a smaller general factor, or g, in the higher-IQ group, a phenomenon C. E. Spearman called the 'Law of Diminishing Returns'. This phenomenon was confirmed in six independent data sets based on three different test batteries (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised; Spearman battery). It implies that psychometric g is less general in persons of high IQ and more general among those of low IQ. Two heretofore unknown effects were revealed consistently: (1) The g loadings of the various tests in a battery do not differ uniformly or randomly between high- and low-IQ groups; rather, the loadings are much more variable for higher-IQ samples than for lower-IQ samples; (2) Those tests in a battery that are less g-loaded (where g loadings are based on the general population) consistently show greater decrements in their g loadings between low- and high-IQ groups than do the more highly g-loaded tests, which show relatively little difference between low- and high-IQ groups.",data/mutualism.pdf --> http://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Regularities-in-Spearmans-Law-of-Diminishing-Returns-2003-by-Arthur-Robert-Jensen.pdf,Regularities in Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns,2003,a. jensen,0.0

"No subject in psychology has pro- voked more intense public controversy than the study of human intelligence. From its beginning, research on how and why people differ in overall mental ability has fallen prey to political and social agendas that obscure or distort even the most well-established scientific findings. Journalists, too, often present a view of intelligence research that is exactly the opposite of what most intel- ligence experts believe. For these and other reasons, public understanding of intelligence falls far short of public con- cern about it. The IQ experts discussing their work in the public arena can feel as though they have fallen down the rabbit hole into Alice’s Wonderland. The debate over intelligence and intelligence testing focuses on the ques- tion of whether it is useful or meaning- ful to evaluate people according to a single major dimension of cognitive competence. Is there indeed a general mental ability we commonly call “intel- ligence,” and is it important in the prac- tical affairs of life? The answer, based on decades of intelligence research, is an unequivocal yes. No matter their form or content, tests of mental skills invari- ably point to the existence of a global factor that permeates all aspects of cog- nition. And this factor seems to have considerable influence on a person’s practical quality of life. Intelligence as measured by IQ tests is the single most effective predictor known of individual performance at school and on the job. It also predicts many other aspects of well- being, including a person’s chances of divorcing, dropping out of high school, being unemployed or having illegitimate children. By now the vast majority of intelli- gence researchers take these findings for granted. Yet in the press and in public debate, the facts are typically dismissed, downplayed or ignored. This misrepresen- tation reflects a clash between a deeply felt ideal and a stubborn reality. The ideal, implicit in many popular critiques of intelligence research, is that all people are born equally able and that social inequali- ty results only from the exercise of unjust privilege. The reality is that Mother Nature is no egalitarian. People are in fact unequal in intellectual potential—and they are born that way, just as they are born with different potentials for height, physical attractiveness, artistic flair, ath- letic prowess and other traits. Although subsequent experience shapes this poten- tial, no amount of social engineering can make individuals with widely divergent mental aptitudes into intellectual equals. Of course, there are many kinds of talent, many kinds of mental ability and many other aspects of personality and character that influence a person’s chances of happiness and success. The functional importance of general mental ability in everyday life, however, means that without onerous restrictions on individual liberty, differences in mental competence are likely to result in social inequality. This gulf between equal opportunity and equal outcomes is per- haps what pains Americans most about the subject of intelligence. The public intuitively knows what is at stake: when asked to rank personal qualities in order of desirability, people put intelligence second only to good health. But with a more realistic approach to the intellectual differences between people, society could better accommodate these differences and minimize the inequalities they create. Extracting g Early in the century-old study of intelligence, researchers discovered that all tests of mental ability ranked individ- uals in about the same way. Although mental tests are often designed to mea- sure specific domains of cognition—ver- bal fluency, say, or mathematical skill, spatial visualization or memory—people who do well on one kind of test tend to do well on the others, and people who do poorly generally do so across the board. This overlap, or intercorrelation, suggests that all such tests measure some global element of intellectual abil- ity as well as specific cognitive skills. In recent decades, psychologists have devoted much effort to isolating that general factor, which is abbreviated g, from the other aspects of cognitive abili- ty gauged in mental tests. The statistical extraction of g is per- formed by a technique called factor analysis. Introduced at the turn of the century by British psychologist Charles Spearman, factor analysis determines the minimum number of underlying dimen- sions necessary to explain a pattern of correlations among measurements. A general factor suffusing all tests is not, as is sometimes argued, a necessary out- come of factor analysis. No general factor has been found in the analysis of per- sonality tests, for example; instead the method usually yields at least five dimen- sions (neuroticism, extraversion, consci- entiousness, agreeableness and openness to ideas), each relating to different sub- sets of tests. But, as Spearman observed, a general factor does emerge from analy- sis of mental ability tests, and leading psychologists, such as Arthur R. Jensen of the University of California at Berkeley and John B. Carroll of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have con- firmed his findings in the decades since. Partly because of this research, most intel- ligence experts now use g as the working definition of intelligence. The general factor explains most differences among individuals in perfor- mance on diverse mental tests.

"The prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with Yali, a New Guinean politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the Europeans who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term ""cargo"" for inventions and manufactured goods, ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""[2]: 14   Diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: ""People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power."" Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, ""have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.""[2]: 15   The peoples of other continents (sub-Saharan Africans, Indigenous people of the Americas, Aboriginal Australians, New Guineans, and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous Khoisan peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and Bantu.

"The three-stratum theory is a theory of cognitive ability proposed by the American psychologist John Carroll in 1993.[1][2] It is based on a factor-analytic study of the correlation of individual-difference variables from data such as psychological tests, school marks and competence ratings from more than 460 datasets. These analyses suggested a three-layered model where each layer accounts for the variations in the correlations within the previous layer.  The three layers (strata) are defined as representing narrow, broad, and general cognitive ability. The factors describe stable and observable differences among individuals in the performance of tasks. Carroll argues further that they are not mere artifacts of a mathematical process, but likely reflect physiological factors explaining differences in ability (e.g., nerve firing rates). This does not alter the effectiveness of factor scores in accounting for behavioral differences.  Carroll proposes a taxonomic dimension in the distinction between level factors and speed factors. The tasks that contribute to the identification of level factors can be sorted by difficulty and individuals differentiated by whether they have acquired the skill to perform the tasks. Tasks that contribute to speed factors are distinguished by the relative speed with which individuals can complete them. Carroll suggests that the distinction between level and speed factors may be the broadest taxonomy of cognitive tasks that can be offered. Carroll distinguishes his hierarchical approach from taxonomic approaches such as Guilford's Structure of Intellect model (three-dimensional model with contents, operations, and products).",data/mutualism.pdf,The Three-Stratum Theory of Cognitive Abilities.,1997,j. carroll,0.0
Stephen Ceci argues that traditional conceptions of intelligence ignore the role of society in shaping intelligence and underestimate the intelligence of non-Western societies.

"The author examines the relative merits of the Binet-Thomson-Guilford theories of intelligence and Spearman's theory of intelligence as"" enerp""'This latter was compatible with Galton's concept of general intelligence as a primarily biological and genetically transmissable reality. Almost from the beginning of the scientific study of human intelligence, there has been an interesting bifurcation, identified with the names and views of Sir Francis Galton and Alfred Binet (Eysenck, 1985, 1986). For Galton, general intelligence was a meaningful concept, based on biological reality, whereas for Binet it was a statistical artefact, nothing more than the average of a number of semi-independent faculties. Galton stressed the genetic side, Binet the educational and environ-mental. Last but not least, Galton looked for physiological methods of measurement, instancing reaction time among others, whereas Binet used tasks involving problem solving, learning, memory, etc. As has been well documented (Eysenck, 1979; Vernon, 1979), Binet's methods of measurement were almost universally adopted, and his general views were very widely accepted, particularly in the United States; psychologists in the United Kingdom were more sympathetic to Galton-type ideas. In recent years, there has been a revolution in this field, based on experimental studies of reaction time and evoked potentials as measures of intelligence (Eysenck, 1983), and these studies may cause a reappraisal of the whole situation (Eysenck & Barrett, 1985). A new"" model for intelligence""(Eysenck, 1982) seems likely to emerge from these upheavals. In this paper an attempt will be made to assess to which extent these recent findings are relevant to another theoretical bifurcation, not unrelated to that mentioned above, namely that between the Thorndike-Thomson theory of bonds (Thorn-dike, Bregman, and Cobb, 1927; Thomson, 1951), and Spear-man's theory of"" energy""(Spearman, 1927). These two causal theories were put forward in an attempt to explain certain agreed observations in the psychometric field, namely that correlations between cognitive tests were almost universally positive ("" positive manifold""), and the resulting matrices tend-ed to have a low rank, possibly rank one. Spearman argued that THE MANKIND QUARTERLY these facts supported his theory of a general factor of intelli-gence ("" g""), whereas Thomson put forward an alternative view which argued that the mind had little structure and that similar psychometric effects would be manifested if"" we have a causal background comprising innumerable bonds, and if any measure-ments we make can be influenced by any sample of that back-ground, one measurement by this sample and another by that, all samples being possible; and if we choose a number of dif-ferent measurements and find their intercorrelations, the matrix of these intercorrelations will tend to be hierarchical, or at least tend to have a low reduced rank""(Thomson, 1951: p. 271). As he also points out, this is nothing to do with the mind: it is simply a mathematical necessity, whatever the material used to illustrate it. These two alternative views had their origin already much earlier (Spearman, 1904; Thomson, 1916, 1919, 1927, 1935), and they attracted much attention. Mathematicians tended to side with Thomson (Bartlett, 1937, McDonald, 1967; Mackie, 1928), and more recently Maxwell (1972), who made an attempt to resurrect Thomson's theory.

"Psychologist Sternberg explains the evolution of theories of intelligence and introduces within this historical context his own theory. His theory invokes components of three kinds: metacomponents--processes involved in planning, monitoring, and evaluating problem-solving activities; performance components--lower-order processes put into play to implement commands of the metacomponents; and knowledge acquisition components--activities instrumental in learning how to solve problems. Sternberg defines intelligence as mental self-management and shows how it is used both in day-to-day problem-solving and in the world of executive decisionmaking, and how it can be nurtured at any age.

"Investigates the validity of inferences made by A. R. Jensen's method with respect to group differences in general intelligence and compares this to the validity of inferences based on multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. For this comparison, population covariance matrices are constructed which incorporate violations of the central assumption underlying Jensen's method for investigating group differences in cognitive tests concerning the existence of g (""general intelligence factor') and/or violations of Spearman's Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that mean differences between blacks and whites on cognitive tests are a function of the tests' g-loadings: tests with higher loadings show larger mean differences than tests with low loadings. The authors demonstrate that Jensen's method is quite insensitive to the violations of Spearman's Hypothesis. This lack of specificity is observed consistently for all types of violations introduced in the present study.

"Investigations of the role of competition, predation and abiotic stress in shaping natural communities were a staple for previous generations of ecologists and are still popular themes. However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms.

"To begin with, a few lines may be useful to mark out the topic which we are going to consider, and to indicate how this fits into the general order of things. A person is aware of himself as existing in the midst of an external world—or at least, so it seems to him. He not only perceives this world and himself, but also thinks about both. As a single word to include the processes of both the perceiving and the thinking, modern psychology employs “ cognition.” But what he thus perceives and thinks about the world and himself, as also about the relations between the two, excites in him activities and states of another kind, such as appetites, aversions, impulses, decisions, voluntary actions, pleasure, sorrow, and so forth. All these, to distinguish them from the cognitive processes, are called “ conative ” and “ affective,” that is to say, striving and feeling. Take as an example the following description from Oliver Twist: “So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?” said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; “ Eh? ” Oliver I 2 THE ABILITIES OF MAN made no reply. But he watched the Jew’s motions, and breathed quickly. ‘ Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?” sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. “ We'll cure you of that, my young master.” The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver’s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room. “I won’t stand by and see it done, Fagin,” cried the girl. ‘You’ve got the boy, and what more would you have? Let him be—let him be—or I shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before my time.” Here is a typical picture of human mental life in one of its most acute phases. Observe how readily and naturally it agrees with the foregoing classification of processes. Fagin sees Oliver, remembers his attempt to escape, thinks of — punishing him, notices his club, marks the boy shrinking away and breathing quickly, perceives him stagger under the blow, hears his agonized whimper, foresees his better obedience in the future, and has the idea of enforcing thelesson with a second blow—all this and suchlike it is that the term “cognition”? has been coined to include. But Fagin also becomes angry at what the boy has done, enter- tains a desire to punish him, relishes the anticipation of his writhing in pain, seizes voluntarily the club and actually uses it—all such processes as these characteristically involve conation and affection. Now, the present volume is primarily concerned with a person’s ability to “ cognise.”” And we must at once demur —it is the chief reason for prefixing this little chapter—to an objection rather in vogue at the present day, which, if admitted, would cut the ground from beneath our feet. This consists in asserting that the processes of cognition cannot possibly be treated apart from those of conation and affection,seeing that all these are but inseparable aspects in the in- THE PROBLEM 3 stincts and behaviour of a single individual, who himself, as the very name implies, is essentially indivisible. To this protest—borrowed from metaphysics—we may reply that certainly an individual cannot be broken up into independent pieces. But no less certainly the various aspects of his behaviour can and must be submitted to separate consideration. Every science whatever, physical no less than psychological, is obliged to dissect its subject- matter, to deal with the different aspects of it in succession, and finally to bring each of these into relation with all the rest. Only by first dividing can the scientist eventually conquer. In general, a person’s total cognitive ability may be re- garded as an instrument or organ at the disposal of any of his conative activities. It is this organ, then, that we are principally about to examine, and with especial reference to its variations of efficiency from one individual to another. The conative activities will only be brought within our scope to the extent that is needful to explain the working of the organ. But even this much will involve treating these activities in a far more fundamental manner than is usual in books on human ability",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.nature.com/articles/120181a0,The abilities of man: Their nature and measurement,1927,C.

"IQ and the Wealth of Nations is a 2002 book by psychologist Richard Lynn and political scientist Tatu Vanhanen.[1] The authors argue that differences in national income (in the form of per capita gross domestic product) are correlated with differences in the average national intelligence quotient (IQ). They further argue that differences in average national IQs constitute one important factor, but not the only one, contributing to differences in national wealth and rates of economic growth.  The book has drawn widespread criticism from other academics. Critiques have included questioning of the methodology used, the incompleteness of the data, and the conclusions drawn from the analysis.[2][3] The 2006 book IQ and Global Inequality is a follow-up to IQ and the Wealth of Nations by the same authors.  Outline The book includes the authors' calculation of average IQ scores for 60 countries, based on their analysis of published reports. It reports their observation that national IQ correlates with gross domestic product per capita at 0.82, and with the rate of economic growth from 1950 to 1990 at 0.64.  The authors believe that average IQ differences between nations are due to both genetic and environmental factors. They also believe that low GDP can cause low IQ, just as low IQ can cause low GDP. (See Positive feedback).  The authors write that it is the ethical responsibility of rich, high-IQ nations to assist poor, low-IQ nations financially, as it is the responsibility of rich citizens to assist the poor. wikipedia",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations,IQ and the wealth of nations,2002,"R.

"Ecological theory suggests that complex food webs should not persist because of their inherent instability. “Real” ecosystems often support a large number of interacting species. A mathematical model shows that fluctuating short-term selection on trophic links, arising from a consumer's adaptive food choice, is a key to the long-term stability of complex communities. Without adaptive foragers, food-web complexity destabilizes community composition; whereas in their presence, complexity may enhance community persistence through facilitation of dynamical food-web reconstruction that buffers environmental fluctuations.

"Discusses a hypothesis of the role of genetics in the g intelligence factor. g can arise from the effect of shared genes influencing cognitive test performance. Population genetics holds that a determinant of retained genetic variation is deleterious mutation load. A simple mathematical demonstration shows that as mutations increase genetic variation, intercorrelation magnitudes become inversely correlated to performance. The hypothesis is plausible and simple, and consistent with the puzzling effect that intercorrelations between cognitive tests are higher at lower ability levels.

"Conventional ecological models show that complexity destabilizes foodwebs, suggesting that foodwebs should have neither large numbers of species nor a large number of interactions. However, in nature the opposite appears to be the case. Here we show that if the interactions between species are allowed to evolve within a generalized Lotka-Volterra model such stabilizing feedbacks and weak interactions emerge automatically. Moreover, we show that trophic levels also emerge spontaneously from the evolutionary approach, and the efficiency of the unperturbed ecosystem increases with time. The key to stability in large foodwebs appears to arise not from complexity per se but from evolution at the level of the ecosystem which favors stabilizing (negative) feedbacks.",data/mutualism.pdf,Stabilization of large generalized Lotka-Volterra foodwebs by evolutionary feedback.,2004,g. ackland i. gallagher,769.0

Simulation studies of twin pairs using simple non-linear development models characterised by chaotic or near-chaotic behavior are presented. The effect of chaotic processes on correlations is to lower them from their initial values, but high initial correlations are affected much less by chaotic and near-chaotic processes than intermediate correlations. Therefore, we would predict that traits affected by chaotic processes would have high MZ and low DZ twin correlations and this is reminiscent of certain traits such as EEG spectra. However the much more frequent observation of MZ correlations close to twice their DZ counterparts would suggest that the role of chaos in development is quite limited.",data/mutualism.pdf,Some implications of chaos theory for the genetic analysis of human development and variation,1999,l. eaves k. kirk n. martin r. russell,822.0

These approaches are evaluated and integrated on the basis of catastrophe theory. In particular, catastrophe theory specifies a set of common criteria for testing the discontinuity hypothesis proposed by Piaget. Separate criteria correspond to distinct methods used in cognitive developmental research. Such criteria are, for instance, the detection of spurts in development, bimodality of test scores, and increased variability of responses during transitional periods. When a genuine stage transition is present, these criteria are expected to be satisfied. A revised catastrophe model accommodating these criteria is proposed for the stage transition in cognitive development from the preoperational to the concrete operational stage.",data/mutualism.pdf,Stagewise cognitive development: an application of catastrophe theory.,1992,h.l.j. van der maas p. molenaar,862.0

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 86 samples that relate WM to intelligence. The average correlation between true-score estimates of WM and g is substantially less than unity (p=.479).

Causal language is pervasive in the analysis of such systems, especially when insight into their behavior is translated into policy decisions.

It is argued here that a regularity notion of causality can only be meaningfully defined for systems with linear interactions among their variables. For the vastly more important class of nonlinear systems, no such notion is likely to exist. This thesis is developed with examples of dynamical systems taken mostly from mathematical biology.

This conception is shown to diverge from current validity theory in several respects. In particular, the emphasis in the proposed conception is on ontology, reference, and causality, whereas current validity theory focuses on epistemology, meaning, and correlation. It is argued that the proposed conception is not only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken in the existing literature. Further, it has clear theoretical and practical implications for validation research.

However, a recent review (Hartmann & Nyborg, 2004) suggests that there is evidence for differences in g saturation by ability level, but that observed age effects on g saturation are most likely to be a consequence of the ability effect. The current study analyzed the standardization data of the most recent Wechsler scales for both children and adults from several different countries. This study did not find evidence to support either the ability or age version of SLODR by using large normative samples for the WISC-IV from the United States, Canada, and Australia, and for the WAIS-III from the same three countries and also from The Netherlands.",10.1027/1614-0001.29.2.57,Spearman's law of diminishing returns in normative samples for the WISC-IV and WAIS-III,2008,d. saklofske zhiming yang jianjun zhu e. austin,934.0

This article begins by observing that the finding of a general factor of intelligence appears to be inconsistent with current findings in neuroscience and cognitive science, where specific connections are argued to be critical for different intellectual abilities and the brain is argued to develop these connections in response to environmental stimuli. However, it is then observed that if people differed in neural plasticity, or the ability to adapt their connections to the environment, then those highly developed in one intellectual ability would be highly developed in other intellectual abilities as well. Simulations are then used to confirm that such a pattern would be obtained. Such a model is also shown to account for many other findings in the field of intelligence that are currently unexplained.

"Spearman's “Law of Diminishing Returns” states that the g saturation of a test is greater for individuals with lower, rather than higher, test scores, and that it decreases with age. A common methodological problem in testing Spearman's “Law of Diminishing Returns” with respect to ability differentiation is how to create the high and low ability groups. This study used data from five samples of Dutch and of immigrants who where administrated traditional cognitive ability tests and cognitively loaded safety suitability tests. Their large average test score difference in cognitive ability produced the two ability level groups required.

"Résumé Les données d'étalonnage des Échelles Différentielles d'Efficiences Intellectuelles ont été analysées de manière à éprouver l'hypothèse de la différenciation des aptitudes cognitives au cours de l'enfance. L'échantillon total (n = 574) a été subdivisé en trois groupes en fonction de l'âge chronologique (4–5, 6–7 et 8–9 ans). Les analyses confirmatoires « multigroupe » montrent que les corrélations inter-sous-tests, les saturations, la corrélation entre les facteurs et la variance résiduelle des sous-tests sont comparables quel que soit l'âge des participants. Ce résultat ne paraît pas être la conséquence d'un biais d'échantillonnage ni d'une liaison positive entre l'âge et la fidélité ou la variabilité des mesures. Comme d'autres études récentes, il invite à reconsidérer l'idée d'une diminution progressive de la contribution du facteur général à la variance des aptitudes pendant l'enfance, tout au moins lorsque les analyses portent sur des échelles composites d'intelligence administrées à des participants non sélectionnés.",10.1016/J.ERAP.2006.10.002 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1162908807000394,Sur la différenciation des aptitudes cognitives de l'enfant,2007,b. facon,1045.0
"Cronbach’s (1957) famous division of scientific psychology into two disciplines is still apparent for the fields of cognition (general mechanisms) and intelligence (dimensionality of individual differences). The welcome integration of the two fields requires the construction of mechanistic models of cognition and cognitive development that explain key phenomena in individual differences research. In this paper, we argue that network modeling is a promising approach to integrate the processes of cognitive development and (developing) intelligence into one unified theory. Network models are defined mathematically, describe mechanisms on the level of the individual, and are able to explain positive correlations among intelligence subtest scores—the empirical basis for the well-known g-factor—as well as more complex factorial structures. Links between network modeling, factor modeling, and item response theory allow for a common metric, encompassing both discrete and continuous characteristics, for cognitive development and intelligence.",10.3390/JINTELLIGENCE5020016,Network Models for Cognitive Development and Intelligence,2017,h.l.j. van der maas k. kan m. marsman c. stevenson,1049.0
"Two studies showed an inverse relationship between ability level and correlations among IQ measures. Low IQ subjects showed much higher correlations than high IQ subjects. Intercorrelations of IQ subtests, correlations of cognitive ability measures with each other, and correlations of IQ with measures of cognitive abilities all displayed the same effect. In the first study, data from two experiments in which subjects took a battery of basic cognitive tasks and a standard IQ test were analyzed. Measures from the basic tasks correlated more highly in the low IQ group than in the high IQ group. In the second study, data from the WAIS-R and WISC-R standardization samples were divided into five ability groups. Average correlations among subtests were computed for each ability group. For both the WAIS-R and WISC-R, average subtest correlations were highest in the low ability group. Correlations declined systematically with increasing IQ. In both studies, correlations were found to be two times higher in low IQ groups than in high IQ groups.",10.1016/S0160-2896(89)80007-8 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289689800078,Correlations of Mental Tests with Each Other and with Cognitive Variables Are Highest for Low IQ Groups.,1989,d. detterman m. daniel,1050.0

A random effects model taking practice and drop-out into account analyzed data from four successive presentations of each of two intelligence tests, two vocabulary tests, and two verbal memory tests during a 17-year longitudinal study of 5,899 community residents whose ages ranged from 49 to 92 years. On intelligence tests, substantial practice effects counteracted true declines observed over 3 to 5 years of aging and remained significant even with intervals of 7 years between successive assessments. Adjustment for practice and drop-out revealed accelerating declines in fluid intelligence and cumulative learning, linear declines in verbal free recall, and no substantial change in vocabulary.

Eighteen-year old conscripts (n = 14,720) representing the whole range of general ability in the male population, except for the mentally retarded, were tested by the Swedish Enlistment Battery. The sample of subjects was divided into 8, 16 and 32 groups according to level of general ability (G), and the amount of variance due to the ability factors Crystallized intelligence (Gc) and General visualization (Gv) was studied over the G levels.

"Scores on cognitive tasks used in intelligence tests correlate positively with each other, that is, they display a positive manifold of correlations. The positive manifold is often explained by positing a dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.",10.1037/0033-295X.113.4.842,A dynamical model of general intelligence: the positive manifold of intelligence by mutualism.,2006,h.l.j. van der maas c. dolan r. grasman j. wicherts h. huizenga m. raijmakers,1060.0
"Are psychometric tests valid for a new reality of artificial intelligence systems, technology-enhanced humans, and hybrids yet to come? Are the Turing Test, the ubiquitous CAPTCHAs, and the various animal cognition tests the best alternatives? In this fascinating and provocative book, Jose Hernandez-Orallo formulates major scientific questions, integrates the most significant research developments, and offers a vision of the universal evaluation of cognition. By replacing the dominant anthropocentric stance with a universal perspective where living organisms are considered as a special case, long-standing questions in the evaluation of behavior can be addressed in a wider landscape. Can we derive task difficulty intrinsically? Is a universal g factor - a common general component for all abilities - theoretically possible? Using algorithmic information theory as a foundation, the book elaborates on the evaluation of perceptual, developmental, social, verbal and collective features and critically analyzes what the future of intelligence might look like.",10.1017/9781316594179,The Measure of All Minds: Evaluating Natural and Artificial Intelligence,2017,j. hernández-orallo,1067.0
"The present study was designed to examine how the correlations between cognitive abilities evolve during adulthood. Data from 1,104 participants on the French version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition were analyzed. The entire sample was divided into four age groups (16-24 years; 25-44 years; 45-69 years and 70-89 years), which were themselves split into two IQ-levels using the mean standard score on Vocabulary and Block Design. For every age group, the mean correlation between subtest scores of low-IQ participants was higher than that of high-IQ participants. There was also no interaction between age and IQ for the strength of subtest relationships. Indeed, the effect sizes of correlation differences between low- and high-IQ participants appeared to be relatively constant across age.

"This paper argues for the scientific utility of the concept ""intelligence"". In the first section three common arguments against the validity of general intelligence are discussed and dismissed. The second section presents the evidence in favour of the proposition that individual differences in IQ may be based on differences in speed of information processing. However, the third section shows that executive functions, particularly inhibitory processes, represent a more likely basis for the development of intelligence. The theory of the minimal cognitive architecture underlying intelligence and development (Anderson, 1992a) shows how speed and executive functioning might represent two dimensions to g--one an individual differences (within age) dimension based on speed and the other a developmental dimension based on changing executive functioning. In the fourth section this theory is used to generate new insights on the nature of intellectual disability and specific cognitive deficits and to make practical suggestions for educational intervention for low-IQ children.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11321198/,Conceptions of intelligence,2001,"Anderson, M.",1081.0
"The search for cognitive elements of human mental ability differences is an interesting one to document, partly because researchers opinions on the same data can be diametrically opposed. The author reviews previous research differences and how prior theory affected the interpretation of these results. There are 3 things that need addressing after agreeing that g does at least emerge from analyses of psychometric test scores: What cognitive theories and variables have been used to try to account for psychometric mental ability differences? What is the place of g versus more specific abilities in this search? What validity do the cognitive variables and theories have, given that they do provide variables that correlate with psychometric g ? In terms of cognitive candidates to account for human ability differences, it is worth discerning 3 broad approaches.

A prominent example is the well-replicated association between inspection time (IT), a measure of perceptual discrimination speed, and intelligence (IQ), where it is not known whether increased speed is a cause or consequence of high IQ. We investigated the direction of causation between IT and IQ in 2012 genetically related subjects from Australia and The Netherlands. Models in which the reliable variance of each observed variable was specified as a latent trait showed IT correlations of -0.44 and -0.33 with respective Performance and Verbal IQ; heritabilities were 57% (IT), 83% (PIQ) and 77% (VIQ).

We investigated the presence of SLODR in the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children—Second Edition (KABC-II), a popular measure of intelligence for children. We used confirmatory factor analysis to investigate the invariance of two hierarchical factor structures across ability groups; the subtest variance explained by the ability factors across groups; and whether SLODR was produced only by subtests with low loadings on the general ability factor. We found that SLODR was present in the KABC-II, and its presence was not dependent on the hierarchical model of intelligence. Moreover, our findings suggest that SLODR acts on g and not on the broad abilities, although the contribution of g to various broad abilities is lower in the high ability group.

A concern about this information—what appears to be wrong with it—is discussed, and the authors offer ideas about what is needed to fill in information that is more nearly correct.

"This text introduces the SIMPLIS command language for structural equation modelling. It is written for students and researchers with limited mathematical and statistical training who need to use structural equation models to analyze their data, and for those who have tried but failed to learn the LISREL command language. It is not a textbook on factor analysis, structural equations or latent variable models, although there are many examples of such in the book. Rather, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the basic ideas and principles of these types of analyses and techniques. The main objective is to demonstrate that structural equation modelling can be done easily without the technical jargon with which it has been associated. The SIMPLIS language shifts the focus away from the technical question ""How to do it"", so that researchers can concentrate on the question, ""What does it all mean?""

First, empirical evidence for this daim is reviewed. The evidence from several studies of both first and second languoge acquisition suggests that normal language learning occurs only when exposure to the languoge begins early in life. With exposure beginning later in life, asymptotic performance in the language declines: the effects over oge of first exposure are approximately linear through childhood, with a flattening of the function in adulthood. These outcomes argue that some type of constraints ensuring successful languoge learning exist early in life, and weaken with increasing maturation. Second, two hypotheses are considered as to the nature of these maturational changes. One hypothesis is that constraints on learning particular to languoge acquisition undergo maturational decay. A second hypothesis, which is considered in more detail, suggests that language learning abilities decline because of the expansion of nonlinguisftc cognitive abilities.",data/mutualism.pdf,Maturational Constraints on Language Learning,1990,e. newport,1119.0
"This paper focuses on Spearman's law of diminishing returns which states that correlations between IQ tests decrease as the intellectual efficiency increases. In the present study, data from the national standardization sample of a French intelligence scale for children aged 4 to 9 years (Echelles Différentielles d'Efficiences Intellectuelles, forme Révisée) were examined to confirm this relationship. Each of the seven subtests of this scale was successively used to divide the sample into two IQ groups (low vs. high IQ) and correlations between the remaining six subtests were computed for each group. Fit measures of matrices revealed that correlations were not statistically different for six of the seven comparisons between low- and high-IQ participants. These results seem to indicate, at least in children aged 4 to 9 years, that lower IQ samples do not manifest a less differentiated pattern of correlations than higher IQ samples.

Important concepts are the process, level, and rate of growth; minimal structural growth level; carrying capacity and unutilized capacity for growth; and feedback delay. Second, a mathematical model of cognitive growth under limited resources is presented, with the conclusion that the most plausible model is a model of logistic growth with delayed feedback. Third, the model is transformed into a dynamic systems model based on the logistic growth equation. This model describes cognitive growth as a system of supportive and competitive interactions between growers. Models of normal logistic growth, U-shaped growth, bootstrap growth, and competitive growth are also presented.

Indeed, some recent studies suggest that age might moderate the effect of IQ on the differentiation of cognitive abilities. The whole sample (N = 1, 120) was divided into six groups based on age (7–9, 10–12 and 13–15 yr) and on the mean of the subject's standard scores for Vocabulary and Block Design (mean < 10 vs. mean ≥ 10). Correlations between the remaining eleven subtests were then calculated for each group. Results showed an age-related increase in relationships among subtests for low-IQ participants, but good stability for high-IQ participants. This confirms the hypothesis of an Age × IQ interaction on the degree of differentiation of abilities and suggests that persons with low IQ do not exhibit a less differentiated pattern of intellectual abilities from the outset of their development.

"Recent work suggests that executive functions, the cornerstone of higher-level cognitive operations, are driven by basic information processing abilities. Using structural equation modeling, with latent variables, the present study provides the first evidence that this driving force begins in infancy, such that abilities in infancy predict executive functions at age 11. Information processing abilities in three domains (attention, processing speed, and memory) were assessed when participants were infants (7 and 12 months) and toddlers (24 and 36 months) and were used to predict three executive functions (working memory, inhibition, and shifting) when participants were 11 years old. A model relating infant abilities to age-11 executive functions fit well, and accounted for 9% to 19% of the variance in the executive functions. Paths from both speed and memory in infancy to age-11 working memory were significant, as was the path from Speed in infancy to age-11 Shifting.

"The capacity to retain information for brief periods of time increases dramatically during the childhood years. The increases in temporary storage of speech-based material that take place in the period spanning the pre-school years and adolescence reflect complex changes in many of the different component processes, including perceptual analysis, construction and maintenance of a memory trace, retention of order information, rehearsal, retrieval and redintegration. Another crucial capacity that undergoes a similar striking development is complex working memory, the ability to manipulate and store material simultaneously. Possible sources of age-related changes in working memory include increases in processing efficiency and attentional capacity, and task-switching. These two short-term memory systems might play significant but distinct roles in supporting the acquisition of knowledge and skills during childhood.

"A framework for skill acquisition is proposed that includes two major stages in the development of a cognitive skill: a declarative stage in which facts about the skill domain are interpreted and a procedural stage in which the domain knowledge is directly embodied in procedures for performing the skill. This general framework has been instantiated in the ACT system in which facts are encoded in a propositional network and procedures are encoded as productions. Knowledge compilation is the process by which the skill transits from the declarative stage to the procedural stage. It consists of the subprocesses of composition, which collapses sequences of productions into single productions, and proceduralization, which embeds factual knowledge into productions. Once proceduralized, further learning processes operate on the skill to make the productions more selective in their range of applications. These processes include generalization, discrimination, and strengthening of productions. Comparisons are made to similar concepts from past learning theories. How these learning mechanisms apply to produce the power law speedup in processing time with practice is discussed.",data/mutualism.pdf,Acquisition of cognitive skill.,1982,john r. anderson,1184.0

"Deary and Pagliari (1991) pointed out that Spearman had presented data showing the same pattern in correlations found by Detterman and Daniel (1989). Correlations among tests are about twice as high for low-IQ subjects as for high-IQ subjects. Spearman suggested that this effect be called the “law of diminishing returns”. He thought that smarter people had more “g”. He also reasoned that, as in psychophysical effects, a constant increment would be less discriminable when added to a large base (high-IQ) than to a small base (low-IQ). These differences in discriminability are what caused the correlations to be lower in groups of high-IQ subjects. But Spearman was wrong on two counts. First, any constant added to either or both members of pairs of observations has no effect on the resulting correlation. So size of base could not produce differences in correlation. Second, if g is defined as whatever causes tests to be positively intercorrelated, then low-IQ subjects have more g than high-IQ subjects because their test scores are more highly correlated. Amount of g, as g interpreted by Spearman, represents stupidity, not intelligence.

"Measures of intelligence were collected in 209 twin pairs at 5, 7, 10, and 12 years of age, as part of a longitudinal project on intelligence, brain function, and behavioral problems. Intelligence was measured at 5, 7, and 10 years of age with the RAKIT, a well-known Dutch intelligence test, consisting of 6 subscales. At 12 years of age, the complete WISC-R was administered (12 subscales). Both intelligence tests resulted in a measure of full-scale IQ (FSIQ). Participation rate is around 93% at age 12. Correlation coefficients over time are high: (r(5-7) = .65; r(5-10) = .65; r(5-12) = .64; r(7-10) = .72; r(7-12) = .69 and r(10-12) = .78). Genetic analyses show significant heritabilities at all ages, with the expected increase of genetic influences and decrease of shared environmental influences over the years. Genetic influences seem to be the main driving force behind continuity in general cognitive ability, represented by a common factor influencing FSIQ at all ages. Shared environmental influences are responsible for stability as well as change in the development of cognitive abilities, represented by a common factor influencing FSIQ at all ages and age-specific influences, respectively.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12211623/,Genetic and Environmental Influences on the Development of Intelligence,2002,m. bartels m. rietveld g. v. baal d. boomsma,1210.0
"Three recent studies have used twin data to explore the possibility of differential contributions of heritability and environmentality to individual differences in cognitive ability as a function of ability level (Detterman, D.

All arrived at different conclusions: higher heritability at the low end, higher heritability at the high end, and no differential influence, respectively. The current report involves a sample of 148 identical and 135 fraternal twin pairs from the Western Twin Project who were tested on a battery of intelligence and achievement tests to further explore the issue. The results suggest no significant differences in heritability at either the high or the low end, although a trend toward higher heritability for children of higher ability is evident. Individual differences for a composite ability/achievement score showed significantly greater influence of shared family environment at the low end than the rest of the distribution. In general, results for cognitive ability and academic achievement were highly similar.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8240212/,"Differences in heritability across groups differing in ability, revisited",1993,l. thompson d. detterman r. plomin,1212.0
"There is a renewed interest in the so-called differentiation theory. This theory states: the higher the level of g, the less the amount of g variance in any particular cognitive test. The implication of the differentiation theory for the scientific concept of intelligence is noteworthy: g could be more germane for low-ability than for high-ability people. A first battery of cognitive tests was applied to a sample of 3430 participants (mean age=23.12 years). The sample of the Spanish standardization of the WAIS-III was also analyzed (823 participants with a mean age=34.41 years). The methodology of Deary et al. [Intelligence 23 (1996) 105] was used for generating fine-grained low- and high-ability groups. The percentage of variance explained by g was computed for low- and high-ability groups, respectively: the mean percentages were 45.85 and 43.96 in the first cognitive battery, and 49.03 and 36.67 in the WAIS-III. These results support the differentiation of intelligence across the range of ability. However, a sample effect is observed: WAIS-III results are more supportive of the differentiation theory. This evidence suggests that ability differentiation could be related to educational differences.",10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00141-1 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289602001411,Intelligence differentiation in adult samples,2003,f. j. abad r. colom manuel juan-espinosa l. f. garcía,1217.0
"The general differentiation hypothesis states that the strength of the correlations among a set of IQ subtests varies with a given variable. Instances of the general differentiation hypothesis that have been considered in the literature include age and ability differentiation. Traditionally, the differentiation effect is attributed to the varying role of g in the subtest scores of an IQ test with the age or ability variable. We argue that this is only one possible way in which a differentiation effect may arise. We discuss five ways in which differentiation can emerge in the higher-order factor model of intelligence, and demonstrate that these can be tested using moderated factor analysis. Using this method, we study the degree in which the various formal conceptualizations of differentiation can be distinguished statistically. We investigate the age and ability differentiation hypotheses in a real data set using both a traditional method and the method of moderated factor analysis. We conclude that results concerning the traditional method can be misleading. In addition, results concerning moderated factor analysis show no evidence for age differentiation, and weak evidence for ability differentiation.",10.1016/J.INTELL.2010.09.002 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289610001108,Modeling differentiation of cognitive abilities within the higher-order factor model using moderated factor analysis,2010,d. molenaar c. dolan j. wicherts h. maas,1222.0
"The present study explored the dimensionality of cognition at 12 months by factor analyzing data from a large cohort of preterm and full-term infants (N=182). Two analyses were done. In the first, using only measures used earlier, when the infants were 7 months of age, the same three factors emerged at 12 months as at the earlier age--namely, Attention (look duration and shift rate), Speed (reaction time), and Recognition Memory (novelty responses). Together, they accounted for 36% of the variance. Loadings for all three factors closely resembled those from the 7-month solution, and individuals showed cross-age stability on factor scores, r=0.24-0.51. The second analysis used an expanded battery of tasks, including some capturing higher order cognitive abilities. The same three factors emerged, along with two new ones--Recall (reproduction of event sequences) and Representational Competence (performance on cross-modal transfer and object permanence) with the five together accounting for 42% of the variance. The results support the idea that discrete cognitive abilities can be detected early in infancy and that these abilities show continuity over the first year.

"Adoption studies can provide direct evidence for the independent effects of family environment and heredity that are always confounded in intact nuclear families. When children are separated from their biological mothers shortly after birth and placed nonselectively in adoptive homes, adoptive-parent/adopted-child resemblance can be ascribed to cultural transmission, whereas biological-parent/adopted-child similarities are due to heritable factors. Furthermore, a longitudinal adoption study facilitates examination of changes in these two main sources of variation during development. The Colorado Adoption Project is the first large-scale longitudinal adoption study of behavioural development and was initiated in 1975. Data were collected from biological parents of 245 adopted children, the adoptive parents and parents of 245 matched nonadopted children. The children have subsequently been tested at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years of age, and at the end of their first year in primary school (average age, 7.4 years). The number of subjects tested is now adequate for analysis of data over 7 years.

"Spearman's “Law of Diminishing Returns” (SLODR) predicts that g saturation for cognitive tests will be lower at high ability levels than at low ability levels. This hypothesis was tested in two large samples of Danish military draftees (n=33,833 and n=25,020). The subjects were representative samples of the young adult male population and 95% were aged 18–19. Both samples were tested with a group intelligence test comprised of four subtests which was used to form high and low ability groups within each sample. The g saturation of the battery was estimated within each group using the average intercorrelation and the total explained variance of the first principal component (PC1) and first factor from a principal axis factoring (PAF1). Two different cutoff points were used to illustrate the effect of difference in standard deviation (S.D.) for subtest and total ability score. For both samples and for both cutoff points, SLODR could not be confirmed. In fact, support was found for the opposite effect, namely, a higher g saturation for the high ability group as compared to the low ability group. Furthermore, SLODR may be dependent upon the cutoffs used to define ability groups and also the number and overall g loading of the cognitive tests used.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289604000534,A test of Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns in two large samples of Danish military draftees,2004,peter v. w. hartmann t. teasdale,1262.0
"We ask how children solve the mapping problem for verb acquisition: how they pair concepts with their phonological realizations in their language. There is evidence that nouns but not verbs can be acquired by pairing each sound (e.g., ‘elephant’) with a concept inferred from the world circumstances in which that sound occurs. Verb meanings pose problems for this word-world mapping procedure, motivating a model of verb mapping mediated by attention to the syntactic structures in which verbs occur (Landau and Gleitman 1985, Gleitman 1990). We present an experiment examining the interaction between a conceptual influence (the bias to interpret observed situations as involving a casual agent) and syntactic influences, as these jointly contribute to children's conjectures about new verb meanings. Children were shown scenes ambiguous as to two interpretations (e.g., giving and getting or chasing and fleeing) and were asked to guess the meaning of novel verbs used to described the scenes, presented in varying syntactic contexts. Both conceptual and syntactic constraints influenced children's responses, but syntactic information largely overwhelmed the conceptual bias. This finding, with collatoral evidence, supports a syntax-mediated procedure for verb acquisition.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384194903468,When it is better to receive than to give: Syntactic and conceptual constraints on vocabulary growth,1994,c. fisher d. g. hallb susan rakowiw l. gleitman r. baillargeon j. deloache h. gleitman j. grimshaw a. joshi m. kelly b. landau anneliese lederer e. markman kevin miller letty naigles elissa newport b. ross sandy waxman,1278.0
"Standardized tests are used widely in comparative studies of clinical populations, either as dependent or control variables. Yet, one cannot always be sure that the test items measure the same constructs in the groups under study. In the present work, 460 participants with intellectual disability of undifferentiated etiology and 488 typical children were tested using Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Data were analyzed using binomial logistic regression modeling designed to detect differential item functioning (DIF). Results showed that 12 items out of 36 function differentially between the two groups, but only 2 items exhibit at least moderate DIF. Thus, a very large majority of the items have identical discriminative power and difficulty levels across the two groups. It is concluded that RCPM can be used with confidence in studies comparing participants with and without intellectual disability. In addition, it is suggested that methods for investigating internal bias of tests used in cross-cultural, cross-linguistic or cross-gender comparisons should also be regularly employed in studies of clinical populations, particularly in the field of developmental disability, to show the absence of systematic measurement error (i.e. DIF) affecting item responses.",10.1016/J.INTELL.2011.04.002 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000547,Do Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices function in the same way in typical and clinical populations?

"Differences between blacks and whites on cognitive ability tests have been attributed to a fundamental difference between these groups in general intelligence (or g, as it is denoted). The hypothesized difference in g gives rise to Spearman's hypothesis, which states that the differences in the means of the tests are related to the tests' factor loadings on g. Jensen has investigated this hypothesis by correlating differences in means and tests' g loadings. The aim of the present article is to investigate B-W differences using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. The advantages of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis over Jensen's test of Spearman's hypothesis are discussed. A published data set is analyzed. Strict factorial invariance is tested and judged to be tenable. Various models are tested, which do and do not incorporate g. It is observed that it is difficult to distinguish between several hypotheses, including and excluding g, concerning group differences. The inability to distinguish between competing models using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the exact nature of black-white differences in cognitive abilities.

"Models of the structure of cognitive abilities suggested by Spearman, Thurstone, Guilford, Vernon and Cattell-Horn are reviewed. It is noted that some of the models include a general intellectual factor (g) while others do not. It is also noted that some models are nonhierarchical, while in others more narrow abilities are subsumed under broader abilities in a hierarchical pattern. An empirical study in which a test battery of 16 tests was administered to some 1000 subjects in the 6th grade is reported. Using the LISREL technique to test different models, good support is obtained for oblique primary factors in the Thurstone tradition as well as for the second-order factors fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and general visualization hypothesized by Cattell and Horn. It is also found, however, that the second-order factor of fluid intelligence i is identical with a third-order g-factor. On the basis of these results a three-level model (the HILI-model) is suggested, with the g-factor at the top, two broad factors reflecting the ability to deal with verbal and figural information, respectively, at the second-order level, and the primary factors in the Thurstone and Guilford tradition at the lowest level.

"A Dynamic Systems Approach to the Development of Cognition and Action presents a comprehensive and detailed theory of early human development based on the principles of dynamic systems theory. Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual, and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action, unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular, they show how by processes of exploration and selection, multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing perception-action categories. Thelen and Smith offer a radical alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic issues in early cognitive development. The book is divided into three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.

"We have examined the stability of psychometric g, the general factor in all mental ability tests or other manifestations of mental ability, when g is extracted from a given correlation matrix by different models or methods of factor analysis. This was investigated in simulated correlation matrices, in which the true g was known exactly, and in typical empirical data consisting of a large battery of diverse mental tests. Theoretically, some methods are more appropriate than others for extracting g, but in fact g is remarkably robust and almost invariant across different methods of analysis, both in agreement between the estimated g and the true g in simulated data and in similarity among the g factors extracted from empirical data by different methods. Although the near-uniformity of g obtained by different methods would seem to indicate that, practically speaking, there is little basis for choosing or rejecting any particular method, certain factor models qua models may accord better than others with theoretical considerations about the nature of g. What seems to us a reasonable strategy for estimating g, given an appropriate correlation matrix, is suggested for consideration. It seems safe to conclude that, in the domain of mental abilities, g is not in the least chimerical.

The results are eminently worthy of the assistance so generously accorded. Thurstone’s previous theoretical account, lucid and comprehensive as it is, is intelligible only to those who have a knowledge of matrix algebra. Hence his methods have become known to British educationists chiefly from the monograph published by W. P. Alexander8. This enquiry has provoked a good deal of criticism, particularly from Professor Spearman’s school ; and differs, as a matter of fact, from Thurstone’s later expositions. Hence it is of the greatest value to have a full and simple illustration of his methods, based on a concrete inquiry, from Professor Thurstone himself.

"Intelligence tests are about one hundred years old. If you agree with Boring (1923) that intelligence is what the intelligence tests measure, then the science of intelligence is one hundred years old. The author will call this psychometrically defined intelligence. Empirically the study of psychometric intelligence is a booming field, for it has led to a very large literature, impressive technological developments, and coherent relationships among test scores (Carroll, 1993). However, it has a weakness. A purely psychometric approach to intelligence lets the technology of measurement define the concept, rather than the concept defining an appropriate measurement technology. Along with many others, the author prefers a more conceptual, less boring approach. The publication of this volume provides an opportunity to look back at what has been done and, with somewhat more hesitation, to attempt to identify what more needs to be done. Like any large intellectual movement, the study of information processing and intelligence has split into several subareas. The most important ones are reviewed in individual chapters in the current volume. The author will try to take a larger view.

"Biological invasions are a pervasive and costly environmental problem that has been the focus of intense management and research activities over the past half century. Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion, is supported by both theory and experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the establishment (number of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced. These results suggest that local biodiversity represents an important line of defence against the spread of invaders.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12050662/,Biodiversity as a barrier to ecological invasion,2002,t. kennedy s. naeem k. howe j. m h knops d. tilman p. reich,1413.0
"Jensen has posited a research method to investigate group differences in cognitive tests. This method consists of first extracting a general intelligence factor by means of exploratory factor analysis. Secondly, similarity of factor loadings across groups is evaluated in an attempt to ensure that the same constructs are measured. Finally, the correlation is computed between the loadings of the tests on the general intelligence factor and the mean differences between groups on the tests. This part is referred to as a test of ""Spearman's Hypothesis"", which essentially states that differences in g account for the main part of differences in observed scores. Based on the correlation, inferences are made with respect to group differences in general intelligence. The validity of these inferences is investigated and compared to the validity of inferences based on multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. For this comparison, population covariance matrices are constructed which incorporate violations of the central assumption underlying Jensen's method concerning the existence of g and/or violations of Spearman's Hypothesis. It is demonstrated that Jensen's method is quite insensitive to the violations. This lack of specificity is observed consistently for all types of violations introduced in the present study.

"A meta-analytic review of the literature on infant habituation and recognition memory performance as predictors of later IQ suggests several conclusions: (1) Habituation and recognition memory assessments made on a variety of risk and nonrisk samples in the first year of life predict later IQ assessed between 1 and 8 years of age with a weighted (for N) average of normalized correlations of .36 or a raw median correlation of .45. (2) The size of the predictive correlation is essentially the same for habituation and for recognition memory paradigms. (3) This prediction phenomenon is not obviously associated solely with one laboratory, one particular infant response measure, or a few extremely disordered infants. (4) The level of prediction to childhood IQ is substantial given the reliability of the infant measures. (5) Predictions are somewhat higher for risk than for nonrisk samples. (6) Predictions are consistently higher than for standardized infant tests of general development for nonrisk but not for risk samples, and they are not consistently higher than predicting from parental education and socioeconomic status or a few other infant behaviours for nonrisk samples.

"Changes in species composition of communities seem to proceed gradually at first sight, but remarkably rapid shifts are known to occur. Although disrupting disturbances seem an obvious explanation for such shifts, evidence for large disturbances is not always apparent. Here we show that complex communities tend to move through occasional catastrophic shifts in response to gradual environmental change or evolution. This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspecific competition is allowed to exceed intraspecific competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat. These results suggest that alternative attractors may commonly arise from interactions between large numbers of species. Consequently, the response of complex communities to environmental change is expected to be characterized by hysteresis and sudden shifts. Some unexplained regime shifts observed in ecosystems could be related to alternative attractors arising from complex species interactions. Additionally, our results support the idea that ancient mass extinctions may partly be due to an intrinsic loss of stability of species configurations.",data/mutualism.pdf,Large Species Shifts Triggered by Small Forces,2004,e. v. van nes m. scheffer,1420.0
"Structural approaches to development, such as Piaget's stage theory, have proved to be problematic in dealing with developmental transitions. More promising in this respect are models of qualitative change that address macroscopical phase shifts in non-linear dynamicalsystems that arise from quantitative changes at the microscopical level. In this introductory paper, we attempt to clarify the meanings of some of the core terms used in these models so as to set the scene for the subsequent contributions. We stress the relevance of recent advances in catastrophe theory for detecting developmental transitions and suggest that the concept of self-organisation as formulated in irreversible thermodynamics provides a framework for explaining them. As yet, there is a lack of convincing evidence that transitions of interest to developmental psychologists comply with principles of self-organisation that have become well-established for time-evolving systems in other disciplines such as chemistry and biology. Demonstrations of self-organisation in psychologically-relevant simulation models are a first step in attaining such evidence. In this special issue, we concentrate primarily on a common approach to the detection of transitions across a number of domains of development.However, in doing so illustrations are given of the ways in which the hypothesis of selforganisation can be used to account for the mechanisms of developmental transitions.",data/mutualism.pdf,Developmental transitions: So what's new?,1998,h. maas b. hopkins,1456.0
"The need to capture the complexity of biological systems in a simpler formalism is the underlying impetus of biological sciences. Understanding the function of many biological complex systems, such as genetic networks or molecular signalling pathways, requires precise identification of the interactions between their individual components. A number of questions in the study of complex systems are then important-in particular, what can be inferred about the interactions in a complex system from an arbitrary set of experiments, and, what is the minimum number of experiments required to characterize the system? This paper shows that the problem of finding the minimal causal structure of a system based on a set of observations is computationally intractable for even moderately sized systems (it is NP-hard), but a reasonable approximation can be found in a relatively short (polynomial) time. Next, it is shown that the number of experiments required to characterize a complex system grows exponentially with the upper bound on the number of immediate upstream influences of each element, but only logarithmically with the number of elements in the system. This makes it possible to study biological systems with extremely large number of interacting elements and relatively sparse interconnections, such as gene regulatory and cell signalling networks. Finally, the construction of a randomized experimental sequence which achieves this bound is discussed.",data/mutualism.pdf,On the number of experiments required to find the causal structure of complex systems.,2002,boris krupa,1463.0
"In this essay we document moderate continuity in mental development beginning in infancy and extending into childhood. Psychological opinion in the past has tended to favor discontinuity theories of cognitive development from infancy. In recent years, however, the foundations on which discontinuity positions were originally established have themselves come under question and new findings grounded in new assessment procedures have appeared, necessitating revision of opinion on this significant psychological and developmental issue. Our essay has several aims. We first review briefly the bases for contemporary discontinuity theories of mental development. Second, we present current findings that support the alternative proposition of continuity: Recent research demonstrates that infants who more efficiently encode visual stimuli or more efficiently recollect visual or auditory stimuli tend to perform more proficiently on traditional psychometric assessments of intelligence and language during childhood. Third, we scrutinize the assessment methods from which these continuity results derive. Fourth, we offer several models that help to explain the continuity findings. Fifth, we discuss critically the origins and the maintenance of continuity in mental development as it is coming to be conceptualized currently. Finally, we reflect on implications of continuity for the future of infant assessments specifically and for theories of early mental development generally.",10.1111/J.1467-8624.1986.TB00025.X,Continuity in mental development from infancy.,1986,m. bornstein m. sigman,1483.0
"This article presents a potential synthesis between the fitness indicator and life history models of human intelligence through consideration of the phenomena of ability differentiation and integration. The cognitive differentiation-integration effort hypothesis proposes that these effects result from a life history tradeoff between cognitive integration effort, a mating effort component associated with strengthening the positive manifold amongst abilities; and cognitive differentiation effort, a somatic effort component associated with the cultivation of specific abilities. This represents one of two largely independent sources of genetic variance in intelligence; the other is mediated by general fitness and mutation load and is associated with individual differences in levels of ‘genetic g‘. These two sources (along with a common source of environmental variance) combine to give rise to a variety of cognitive phenotypes characterized by different combinations of high or low levels of ‘genetic g‘ and cognitive specialism or generalism. Fundamental to this model is the assumption that measures of life history speed (K) and g are essentially independent, which is demonstrated via meta-analysis of 10 studies reporting correlations between the variables (ρ = .023, ns, n = 2056). The implications of the model are discussed in an evolutionary, ecological, and developmental context. Seven key predictions are made in the discussion which if tested could provide definitive evidence for the hypothesis.",10.1037/a0024348,The Cognitive Differentiation-Integration Effort Hypothesis: A Synthesis between the Fitness Indicator and Life History Models of Human Intelligence,2011,m. woodley,1518.0
"General ability, defined as psychometric g, arises from the empirical fact that scores on various cognitive tests are positively correlated in the population. The g factor is highly stable across different factor analytic algorithms, across different test batteries and across different populations. Because all cognitive tests, from the simplest to the most complex, regardless of their informational content, are g-loaded to varying degrees, g cannot be described in terms of the tests' content, or even in psychological terms. It is actually a property of the brain. The loadings of various tests on g, from tests of sensory discrimination and reaction time to those of highly complex problem solving, predict those tests' degree of correlation with a number of non-psychometric variables: the test's heritability, inbreeding depression, coefficient of assortative mating, brain size, reaction time, brain nerve conduction velocity, brain glucose metabolic rate and features of brain evoked potentials. Although some of the brain's cognitive functions are modular, the g factor reflects the all-positive correlations among virtually all cognitive functions that show individual differences. I hypothesize that the brain contains no module for general problem solving. Correlations between individuals' performances in various cognitive tasks result from quantitative individual differences in physiological conditions that do not constitute the brain's modular and other neural design features but do influence their speed and efficiency of information processing.",10.1038/381729B0 --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11276908/,The g factor,1996,a. jensen,1567.0
"The law of diminishing returns (Spearman, 1927) states that the size of the average correlation between cognitive tasks tends to be relatively small in high-ability groups and relatively high in low-ability groups. Studies supporting this finding have tended to contrast very low-ability subjects (IQ < 78) with subjects from higher ability ranges and to use tests that have poor discriminatory power among the higher ability levels. In the first study described in this article, tasks that provide good discrimination among the higher ability levels were used. A sample of high-ability (N = 25) and of low-ability (N = 20) 15-year-old boys completed four single tests, two with low and two with high g saturations, and two competing tasks formed from these single tests. The results indicated that, contrary to the predictions of the law of diminishing returns, the amount of common variance was greater in the high-ability group. It is suggested that the law of diminishing returns does not take into account the factor of task difficulty and that there are situations in which the exact reverse of this law holds. A second study again compared correlations obtained with extreme groups (N = 28 and N = 29), this time on measures of perceptual speed, which are easy for all ability levels. Results indicated that correlations among the perceptual speed measures were the same for both groups. In neither of these studies was there any support for the law, which seems to be dependent on the very high correlations obtained from samples at the extreme lower end of the ability continuum.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160289695900241,Challenging the 'Law of diminishing returns',1995,g. fogarty l. stankov,1588.0
"We investigate a mutualistic metacommunity where the strength of the mutualistic interaction between species is measured by the extent to which the presence of one species on a patch either reduces the extinction rate of the others present on the same patch or increases their ability to colonize other patches. In both cases, a strong enough mutualism enables all species to persist at habitat densities where they would all be extinct in the absence of the interaction. However, a mutualistic interaction that enhances colonization enables the species to persist at lower habitat density than one that suppresses extinction. All species abruptly go extinct (catastrophe) when the habitat density is decreased infinitesimally below a critical value. A comparison of the mean field or spatially implicit case with unrestricted dispersal and colonization to all patches in the system with a spatially explicit case where dispersal is restricted to the immediate neighbours of the original patch leads to the intriguing conclusion that restricted dispersal can be favourable for species that have a beneficial effect on each other when habitat conditions are adverse. When the mutualistic interaction is strong enough, the extinction threshold or critical amount of habitat required for the persistence of all species is lower when the dispersal is locally restricted than when unrestricted ! The persistence advantage for all species created by the mutualistic interaction increases substantially with the number of species in the metacommunity, as does the advantage for restricted dispersal over global dispersal.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14766189/,Habitat destruction in mutualistic metacommunities.,2004,s. prakash a. d. de roos,1614.0
"Darwin considered an understanding of the evolution of the human mind and brain to be of major importance to the evolutionary sciences. This groundbreaking book sets out a comprehensive, integrated theory of why and how the human mind has developed to function as it does. Geary proposes that human motivational, affective, behavioral, and cognitive systems have evolved to process social and ecological information (e.g., facial expressions) that covaried with survival or reproductive options during human evolution. Further, he argues that the ultimate focus of all of these systems is to support our attempts to gain access to and control of resources - more specifically, the social (e.g., mates), biological (e.g., food), and physical (e.g., territory) resources that supported successful survival and reproduction over time. In this view, Darwin's conceptualization of natural selection as a ""struggle for existence"" becomes, for us, a struggle with other human beings for control of the available resources. This struggle provides a means of integrating modular brain and cognitive systems such as language with those brain and cognitive systems that support general intelligence. To support his arguments, Geary draws on an impressive array of recent findings in cognitive science and neuroscience as well as primatology, anthropology, and sociology. The book also explores a number of issues that are of interest in modern society, including how general intelligence relates to academic achievement, occupational status, and income. Readers will find this book a thought-provoking read and an impetus for new theories of mind.",10.1037/10871-000,"The Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence",2004,d. geary,1636.0
"Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns (SLODR) is the idea that the structure of human cognitive ability is more differentiated and g a weaker determinant of cognitive performance at higher levels of ability. In this study, we distinguish between ‘traditional’ methods of testing SLODR and ‘contemporary’ methods of testing SLODR. It is the former set of methods from which the vast majority of the evidence base for SLODR derives. We demonstrated that it is easy to mimic SLODR and reverse SLODR effects in these traditional methods of assessing SLODR by using data with skewed observed variable distributions. The skewness magnitudes did not need to be large to produce these effects and they fell well within the range of values that are usually considered unproblematic for parametric statistic analysis. In simulated datasets, positive subtest skewness resulted in SLODR and negative subtest skewness resulted in reverse SLODR. In contemporary methods of testing SLODR, non-linear g-loadings or a skewed g are assumed to reflect evidence for SLODR. When we applied contemporary methods of testing SLODR to these data, there was evidence of heteroscedastic residuals but no evidence of non-linear g-loadings or skewed g distributions. We broadly replicated the effects of subtest skew from these simulated datasets in real data from the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart. Results imply that traditional methods of assessing SLODR cannot distinguish between effects due to subtest characteristics that have nothing to do with differences in ability structure at different levels of g and true SLODR effects. This calls into question the empirical support for SLODR.",10.1016/J.INTELL.2013.06.007 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000809,Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns: A statistical artefact?,2013,a. murray h. dixon w. johnson,1671.0
"This study investigates whether a unitary elemental process or a number of independent elemental processes, as measured by elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs), underlie psychometric g. A sample of 101 university students was administered two intelligence tests (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery) and a large battery of ECTs. The results of this study reject the theory that some single or unitary process underlies psychometric g. Rather, it appears that individual differences in psychometric g may reflect as many as four independent components of variance. These findings support the theory that various complex mental tests correlate highly with each other, giving rise to a psychometric g factor, because they require some of the same elemental processes. Further research will be needed to determine precisely the number and nature of these components. It is also important to note that the multiple correlation of g regressed on these four components derived from elementary cognitive variables is .542. The maximum correlation possible between the psychometric variables and the battery of ECTs in this study is nearly as high as correlations among various standardized IQ tests themselves (canonical r=.603). After correction for the considerable restriction of range on IQ in the sample, the r is increased to .722. Hence, this battery of ECTs accounts for approximately half of the phenotypic variance in g and probably as much as 70% of the genotypic variance. Moreover, the finding that individual differences in conceptually distinct processes (such as speed of visual search and speed of memory search) are highly correlated indicates the presence of individual differences in some neurological level of processing common to both tasks.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016028969190003V,The nature of psychometric g: Unitary process or a number of independent processes?,1991,j. kranzler a. jensen,1796.0
"By the end of the 1970s, about 50 years of research had shown fairly clearly that prediction coefficients from measures of infant behaviour to later measures of intelligence in childhood were so low as to indicate that, except in extreme cases such as severe subnormality, the early measures had no predictive validity.1 2 From about this time, however, researchers began to question the nature and validity of the infant tests on which these findings were based. It was argued that the ‘mental scales’ on these tests primarily measured perceptual and motor development, rather than mental or cognitive growth, and there is little reason to expect measures of such abilities to predict later IQ.3 4 

Accordingly, the search began for cognitive or information processing measures of infant performance which might more reasonably be considered to tap abilities that are similar to, and may be predictive of, the abilities measured by the childhood intelligence tests. A major focus of this research has been on measures of visual information processing and attentiveness, and it has become clear that a moderate degree of predictability may be possible, leading some to the view that the ‘promise of greater predictive accuracy using recognition memory and habituation rate represents one of the most exciting contemporary fields of inquiry’.5 

One of the best known and most widely used tests of infant development is the Bayley scales of infant development (BSID). In the second edition of these scales published in 1993, many items on the mental development index appear to measure perceptual-motor rather than mental or cognitive development. At 4 months the items include: #36 ‘eyes follow rod’; #44 ‘uses eye-hand coordination in reaching’; and #45 ‘picks up cube’. At 12 months the items include: #73 ‘turns pages of book’; #79 ‘fingers holes in pegboard’; and …",data/mutualism.pdf,Can measures of infant habituation predict later intellectual ability?,1997,a. slater,1870.0
"The longitudinal rank-order stability of cognitive ability increases dramatically over the life span. Theoretical perspectives differ in their emphasis on genetic mechanisms in explaining the longitudinal stability of cognition and how stability changes with development. However, the patterns of stability of genetic and environmental influences on cognition over the life span remain poorly understood. We searched for longitudinal studies of cognition that reported raw genetically informative longitudinal correlations or parameter estimates from longitudinal behavior genetic models. We identified 150 combinations of time points and measures from 15 independent longitudinal samples. In total, longitudinal data came from 4,548 monozygotic twin pairs raised together, 7,777 dizygotic twin pairs raised together, 34 monozygotic twin pairs raised apart, 78 dizygotic twin pairs raised apart, 141 adoptive sibling pairs, and 143 nonadoptive sibling pairs, ranging in age from infancy through late adulthood. At all ages, cross-time genetic correlations and shared environmental correlations were substantially larger than cross-time nonshared environmental correlations. Cross-time correlations for genetic and shared environmental components were, respectively, low and moderate during early childhood, increased sharply over child development, and remained high from adolescence through late adulthood. Cross-time correlations for nonshared environmental components were low across childhood and gradually increased to moderate magnitudes in adulthood. Increasing phenotypic stability over child development was almost entirely mediated by genetic factors. Time-based decay of genetic and shared environmental stability was more pronounced earlier in child development. Results are interpreted in reference to theories of gene-environment correlation and interaction.",10.1037/a0035893,Continuity of genetic and environmental influences on cognition across the life span: a meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies.,2014,e. tucker-drob d. briley,1872.0
"The study subjected nine elementary cognitive task variables from the Cognitive Assessment Tasks (CAT) and three scholastic measures from the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) to phenotypic and behavioral genetic structural equation modeling based on data for 277 pairs of same sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins from the Western Reserve Twin Project. Phenotypic and behavioral genetic covariation between certain elemental cognitive components and scholastic performance was examined to determine (a) whether these elemental cognitive components contribute substantially to the variance of scholastic performance; (b) whether such contributions vary across different domains of school knowledge or from specific domains to a general aptitude; (c) the behavioral genetic composition of the elemental cognitive components and the scholastic variables; and (d) how the association between the cognitive components and scholastic performance is genetically and environmentally mediated. The results of the study showed that as much as 30% of the phenotypic variance of scholastic performance was accounted for by the CAT general factor, which was presumably related to mental speed. A mainly genetic covariation was found between the mental speed component and scholastic performance, although each of the two variables was strongly influenced by both heritability and common family environment. The magnitude and etiology of the covariation were largely invariant whether mental speed was related to a common scholastic aptitude or to individual achievement measures covering different knowledge domains. Taken in conjunction with previous findings that mental speed has a substantial genetic correlation with psychometric g, and psychometric g has a mostly genetic covariation with scholastic achievement, the findings of the present study seems to point to a more global picture; namely, there is a causal sequence that starts from mental speed as the explanatory factor for both psychometric g and scholastic performance, and the etiology of the causal link is chiefly genetic.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12837014/,Phenotypic and Behavioral Genetic Covariation Between Elemental Cognitive Components and Scholastic Measures,2003,dasen luo l. thompson d. detterman,2091.0
"I examine Gleitman's (1990) arguments that children rely on a verb's syntactic subcategorization frames to learn its meaning (e.g., they learn that see means ‘perceive visually’ because it can appear with a direct object, a clausal complement, or a directional phrase). First, Gleitman argues that the verbs cannot be learned byb observing then situations in which they are used , because many verbs refer to overlapping situations, and because parents do not invariably use a verb when its perceptual correlates are present. I suggest that these arguments speak only against a narrow associationist view in which the child is sensitive to the temporal contiguity of sensory features and spoken verb, If the child can hyppthesize semantic representations corresponding to what parents are likely to be referring to, and can refine such representations across multiple situations, the objections are blunted;, indeed, Gleitman's theory requires such a learning process despite her objections to it. Second, Gleitmans suggests that there is enough information in a verb's subcategorization frames to predict its meaning ‘quite closely’ . Evaluating this argument requires distinguishing a verb's root plus its semantic content (what She boiled the water shares with The water boiled and does not share with She broke the glass), and a verb frame plus its semantic perspective (what She boiled the water shares with She broke the glass and does not share with The water boiled). I show that learning a verb in a single frame only gives a learner coarse information about its semanic perspective in that frame (e.g., number of arguments, type of arguments); it tells the learner nothing about the verb root's content across frames (e.g., hot bubbling liquid). Moreover, hearing a verb across all its frames also reveals little about the verb root's content. Finally, I show that Gleitman's empirical arguments all involve experiments where children are exposed to a single verb frame, and therefore all involve learning the frame's perpective meaning, not the root's content meaning, which in all the experiments was acquired by observing the accompanying scene. I conclude that attention to a verb's syntactic frame can help narrow down the child's interpretation of the perspective meaning of the verb in that frame, but disagree with the claim that there is some in-principle limitation in learning a verb's content.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384194903476,How could a child use verb syntax to learn verb semantics,1994,s. pinker,2415.0
"Basic Lotka-Volterra type models in which mutualism (a type of symbiosis where the two populations benefit both) is taken into account, may give unbounded solutions. We exclude such behaviour using explicit mass balances and study the consequences of symbiosis for the long-term dynamic behaviour of a three species system, two prey and one predator species in the chemostat. We compose a theoretical food web where a predator feeds on two prey species that have a symbiotic relationships. In addition to a species-specific resource, the two prey populations consume the products of the partner population as well. In turn, a common predator forages on these prey populations. The temporal change in the biomass and the nutrient densities in the reactor is described by ordinary differential equations (ODE). Since products are recycled, the dynamics of these abiotic materials must be taken into account as well, and they are described by odes in a similar way as the abiotic nutrients. We use numerical bifurcation analysis to assess the long-term dynamic behaviour for varying degrees of symbiosis. Attractors can be equilibria, limit cycles and chaotic attractors depending on the control parameters of the chemostat reactor. These control parameters that can be experimentally manipulated are the nutrient density of the inflow medium and the dilution rate. Bifurcation diagrams for the three species web with a facultative symbiotic association between the two prey populations, are similar to that of a bi-trophic food chain; nutrient enrichment leads to oscillatory behaviour. Predation combined with obligatory symbiotic prey-interactions has a stabilizing effect, that is, there is stable coexistence in a larger part of the parameter space than for a bi-trophic food chain. However, combined with a large growth rate of the predator, the food web can persist only in a relatively small region of the parameter space. Then, two zero-pair bifurcation points are the organizing centers. In each of these points, in addition to a tangent, transcritical and Hopf bifurcation a global heteroclinic bifurcation is emanating. This heteroclinic cycle connects two saddle equilibria where the predator is absent. Under parameter variation the period of the stable limit cycle goes to infinity and the cycle tends to the heteroclinic cycle. At this global bifurcation point this cycle breaks and the boundary of the basin of attraction disappears abruptly because the separatrix disappears together with the cycle. As a result, it becomes possible that a stable two-nutrient-two-prey population system becomes unstable by invasion of a predator and eventually the predator goes extinct together with the two prey populations, that is, the complete food web is destroyed. This is a form of over-exploitation by the predator population of the two symbiotic prey populations. When obligatory symbiotic prey-interactions are modelled with Liebig's minimum law, where growth is limited by the most limiting resource, more complicated types of bifurcations are found. This results from the fact that the Jacobian matrix changes discontinuously with respect to a varying parameter when another resource becomes most limiting.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15293013/,Consequences of symbiosis for food web dynamics,2004,b. kooi l. kuijper s. kooijman,3218.0
"Eighteen shallow lakes in The Netherlands were subjected to biomanipulation, i.e. drastic reduction of the fish stock, for the purpose of lake restoration. The morphology and the nutrient level of the lakes differed, as did the measures applied. In some lakes biomanipulation was accompanied by reduction of the phosphorus loading. In all but two lakes, the Secchi disk transparency increased after the fish removal. Eight lakes (no phosphorus loading reduction, except for one lake) showed a strong and quick response to the measures: the bottom of the lake became visible (`lake bottom view') and there was a massive development of submerged macrophytes. In eight other lakes the water transparency increased, but lake bottom view was not obtained. In the biomanipulated lakes the decrease in total phosphorus and chlorophyll aand the increase in Secchi disk transparency were significantly stronger than the general trend occurring in Dutch lakes where no measures had been taken. The improvement in the Secchi depth and chlorophyll awas also stronger than in lakes where only the phosphorus load was reduced. The critical factor for obtaining clear water was the extent of the fish reduction in winter. Significant effects were observed only after >75% fish reduction. Success seems to require substantial fish manipulation. In such strongly biomanipulated lakes, wind resuspension of the sediment never prevented the water from becoming clear. No conclusion can be drawn with respect to the possible negative impact of cyanobacteria or Neomysison grazing by Daphniaand consequently on water clarity. In all lakes where there had been a high density of cyanobacteria or years with a high density of Neomysisother factors such as insufficient fishery may explain why lake bottom view was not obtained. In all lakes with additional phosphorus loading reduction the fish stock has been reduced less drastically (15–60%). In these lakes the effects on transparency were less pronounced than in the lakes with > 75% fish removal. Daphniagrazing seems responsible for spring clearing in all clear lakes but one. In three lakes the reduction of benthivorous fish also increased the transparency. The factors that determine water clarity in summer are less obvious. In most clear lakes a low algal biomass coincided with a macrophyte coverage of more than 25% of the lake surface area. However, it was not clear what mechanism caused the low algal biomass in summer, although inorganic nitrogen concentrations were regularly found to be very low. Daphniagrazing in open water seemed to be of little importance for suppressing the algal biomass in summer. Although in most lakes the total phosphorus concentration decreased after the biomanipulation, the dissolved phosphorus concentration remained too high to cause phosphorus limitation of the algal growth. In four out of six clear lakes for which there are long-term data the transparency decreased again after 4 years. In one lake with lower nutrient levels the Secchi disk transparency increased over the years. However, the number of lakes with low nutrient levels is too small for conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of nutrient levels on the stability of the clear water state.",data/mutualism.pdf --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017045518813,Biomanipulation in shallow lakes in The Netherlands: an evaluation of 18 case studies,1999,m. meijer ingeborg j de boois m. scheffer r. portielje h. hosper,3240.0
"We propose that connectionism and dynamic systems theory are strong contenders for a general theory of development that holds true whatever the content domain. We illustrate, through our own career narratives, the origins of these theories in motor and language development. We situate connectionism and dynamic systems among other classic and contemporary theories and conclude that, although there are meaningful differences, these differences pale in relation to the shared assumptions about the fundamental processes and mechanisms of change. Once upon a time, thanks to Jean Piaget, the field of cognitive development had a coherent, interesting, testable, and widely accepted theory. Now, alas, we are back in the preparadigmatic boat with our colleagues in the rest of psychology, with theory fragments, almost-theories, and pseudotheories bobbing about around us. . . . I will try to differentiate several distinct possibilities for future theories. . . . Most probably each of these theories will turn out to be true of different aspects of development. . . . For any particular developmental phenomenon, one theory or another will be true, and we want to know which one it is. (Gopnik, 1996, p. 221) According to Alison Gopnik’s vision of the postPiagetian era, the search for a grand developmental theory is futile. Piaget was wrong: broad, general explanations seem ‘increasingly implausible’ (p. 221) and efforts are better spent working out the details, domain-by-domain. The traditional big issues of developmental theory ‐ nature vs. nurture, continuity and discontinuity, modularity vs. distributed processes, and so on ‐ should be cast aside in favor of specific theories about content. While we agree about the importance of the details, we also believe that Gopnik, and others who espouse the domain-specific view, have scuttled the theoretical boat somewhat prematurely. In this special issue of Developmental Science we present a discussion of two contemporary contenders for the ‘big picture’: connectionism and dynamic systems theory. The articles are the result of a symposium held at the 2001 meeting of the Society for Research in Child Development. The large audience who attended the symposium presumably did not share Gopnik’s pessimism over the future of developmental theory (although it is possible they came to witness the duel-to-the death!). Rather, we sensed a growing interest and excitement, especially as these new theories are implemented in mathematical models, and thus, make contact with similar theoretical enterprises in cognitive science, biology and neuroscience. Here we focus specifically on the question of whether we are dealing with one grand theory or two: how alike or how different are connectionism and dynamic systems? To begin, we state forthrightly that we do believe that there are general principles of development: mechanisms and processes that hold true whatever the content domain. Moreover, we assert that researchers make theoretical assumptions about these processes and mechanisms whenever they design and conduct a study. Often these assumptions are implicit, but they influence every decision about the choice of variables, design, research population, sampling intervals and statistical technique. Good theory makes these assumptions explicit, and subjects them to empirical test. Furthermore, the role of formal models is to make these underlying assumptions extremely precise. The specific form of the model is thus less important than the general principles of development on which it is based. We devote our introduction, therefore, to the developmental principles ‐ the qualitative theory and assumptions ‐ that form the bases for the two related approaches of connectionism and dynamic systems. We compare them to the assumptions of other general theories and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each. Note that there is a not-so-subtle irony here. Neither author, Bates nor Thelen, has ever programmed a computer, written an original equation, or run a simulation.

"Motivational processes influence a child's acquisition, transfer, and use of knowledge and skills, yet educationally relevant conceptions of motivation have been elusive. Using recent research within the social-cognitive framework, Dweck describes adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns and presents a research-based model of motivational processes. This model shows how the particular goals children pursue on cognitive tasks shape their reactions to success and failure and influence the quality of their cognitive performance. Dweck argues that this approach has important implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes. She presents a compelling proposal for explaining motivational influences on gender differences in mathematics achievement and observes that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies.--The Editors Most research on effective learning and performance of cognitive tasks analyzes the particular cognitive skills required to succeed at those tasks. In contrast, the focus here is on motivational processes that affect success on cognitive tasks. That is, the focus is on psychological factors, other than ability, that determine how effectively the individual acquires and uses skills. It has long been known that factors other than ability influence whether children seek or avoid challenges, whether they persist or withdraw in the face of difficulty, and whether they use and develop their skills effectively. However, the components and bases of adaptive motivational patterns have been poorly understood. As a resuit, commonsense analyses have been limited and have not provided a basis for effective practices. Indeed, many ""commonsense"" beliefs have been called into question or seriously qualified by recent research--for example, the belief that large amounts of praise and success will establish, maintain, or reinstate adaptive patterns, or that ""brighter"" children have more adaptive patterns and thus are more likely to choose personally challenging tasks or to persist in the face of difficulty. In the past 10 to 15 years a dramatic change has taken place in the study of motivation. This change has resulted in a coherent, replicable, and educationally relevant body of findings--and in a clearer understanding of motivational phenomena. During this time, the emphasis has shifted to a social-cognitive approachwaway from external contingencies, on the one hand, and global, internal states on the other. It has shifted to an emphasis on cognitive mediators, that is, to how children construe the situation, interpret events in the situation, and process information about the situation. Although external contingencies and internal affective states are by no means ignored, they are seen as part of a process whose workings are best penetrated by focusing on organizing cognitive variables. Specifically, the social-cognitive approach has allowed us to (a) characterize adaptive and maladaptive patterns, (b) explain them in terms of specific underlying processes, and thus (c) begin to provide a rigorous conceptual and empirical basis for intervention and practice. Adaptive and Maladaptive Motivational Patterns The study of motivation deals with the causes of goaloriented activity (Atkinson, 1964; Beck, 1983; Dollard & Miller, 1950; Hull, 1943; Veroff, 1969). Achievement motivation involves a particular class of goals--those involving competence--and these goals appear to fall into two classes: (a) learning goals, in which individuals seek to increase their competence, to understand or master something new, and (b) performance goals, in which individuals seek to gain favorable judgments of their competence or avoid negative judgments of their competence (Dweck & Elliott, 1983; NichoUs, 1984; Nicholls & Dweck, 1979). l Adaptive motivational patterns are those that promote the establishment, maintenance, and attainment of personally challenging and personally valued achievement goals. Maladaptive patterns, then, are associated with a failure to establish reasonable, valued goals, to maintain effective striving toward those goals, or, ultimately, to attain valued goals that are potentially within one's reach. Research has clearly documented adaptive and maladaptive patterns of achievement behavior. The adaptive (""mastery-oriented"") pattern is characterized by challenge seeking and high, effective persistence in the face of obstacles. Children displaying this pattern appear to enjoy exerting effort in the pursuit of task mastery. In contrast, the maladaptive (""helpless"") pattern is characterized by challenge avoidance and low persistence in the face of difficulty. Children displaying this pattern tend to evidence negative affect (such as anxiety) and negative self-cogniCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Carol S. Dweck, Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, 603 E. Daniel, Champaign, IL 61820. l The word performance will be used in several ways, not only in connection with performance goals. It will also be used to refer to the child's task activity (performance of a task) and to the product of that activity (level of performance). The meaning should be clear from the context. 1040 October 1986 9 American Psychologist Copyrisht 1986 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. 0003-066X/86/$00.75 Vol. 41, No. 10, 1040-1048 Table 1 Achievement Goals and Achievement Behavior Confidence in Theory of intelligence Goal orientation present ability Behavior pattern Entity theory (Intelligence is fixed) Incremental theory (Intelligence is malleable) > Performance goal (Goal is to gain positive judgments/avoid negative judgments of competence) > Learning goal (Goal is to increase competence) If high ---> Mastery-oriented Seek challenge but High persistence If low ~ Helpless Avoid challenge Low persistence If high > Mastery-oriented ioOr ~ ' Seek challenge (that fosters learning) High persistence tions when they confront obstacles (e.g., Ames, 1984; C. Diener & Dweck, 1978, 1980; Dweck & Reppucci, 1973; Nicholls, 1975). Although children displaying the different patterns do not differ in intellectual ability, these patterns can have profound effects on cognitive performance. In experiments conducted in both laboratory and classroom settings, it has been shown that children with the maladaptive pattern are seriously hampered in the acquisition and display of cognitive skills when they meet obstacles. Children with the adaptive pattern, by contrast, seem undaunted or even seem to have their performance facilitated by the increased challenge. If not ability, then what are the bases of these patterns? Most recently, research has suggested that children's goals in achievement situations differentially foster the two patterns. That is, achievement situations afford a choice of goals, and the one the child preferentially adopts predicts the achievement pattern that child will display. Table 1 summarizes the conceptualization that is emerging from the research. BasieaUy, children's theories of intelligence appear to orient them toward different goals: Children who believe intelligence is a fixed trait tend to orient toward gaining favorable judgments of that trait (performance goals), whereas children who believe intelligence is a malleable quality tend to orient toward developing that quality (learning goals). The goals then appear to set up the different behavior patterns. 2 Learning and Performance Goals Contrasted How and why do the different goals foster the different patterns? How do they shape task choice and task pursuit to facilitate or impede cognitive performance? The research reviewed below indicates that with performance goals, the entire task choice and pursuit process is built around children's concerns about their ability level. In contrast, with learning goals the choice and pursuit processes involve a focus on progress and mastery through 2 See M. Bandura and Dweck (1985), Dweck and Elliott (1983), and Leggett (1985) for a more extensive treatment of children's theories of intelligence. The present article will focus on achievement goals and their allied behavior patterns. effort. Further, this research shows how a focus on ability judgments can result in a tendency to avoid and withdraw from challenge, whereas a focus on progress through effort creates a tendency to seek and be energized by challenge. Although relatively few studies as yet have explicitly induced and compared (or measured and compared) learning versus performance goals (see M. Bandura & Dweck, 1985; Elliott & Dweck, 1985; FarreU & Dweck, 1985; Leggett, 1985, 1986), many have manipulated the salience and value of performance goals, and hence the relative value of the two types of goals. This has been done, for example, by instituting a competitive versus individual reward structure (e.g., Ames, 1984; Ames, Ames, & Felker, 1977), by varying the alleged diagnosticity of the task vis vis important abilities (e.g., Nicholls, 1975), by introducing an audience or evaluator versus allowing the individual to perform privately or focusing his or her attention on the task (e.g., Brockner & Hulton, 1978; Carver & Scheier, 1981; E. Diener & SruU, 1979), and by presenting the task with ""test"" instructions versus ""game"" or neutral instructions (e.g., Entin & Raynor, 1973; Lekarczyk & Hill, 1969; McCoy, 1965; Sarason, 1972). Taken together, the results suggest that highlighting performance goals relative to learning goals can have the following effects on achievement behavior. Goals and Task Choice Appropriately challenging tasks are often the ones that are best for utilizing and increasing one's abilities. Recent research has shown that performance goals work against the pursuit of challenge by requiring that children's perceptions of their ability be high (and remain high) before the children will desire a challenging task (M. Bandura & D",data/mutualism.pdf,Motivational processes affecting learning.,1986,c. dweck,10000.0
