The researchers applied a hedonic pricing model to 15,716 Airbnb listings. As expected, the results show that physical characteristics, location, and host characteristics significantly impact price. Interestingly, more reviews are associated with a drop in price. This information is useful to hosts who are forming a pricing strategy for their listings as well as for Airbnb, who needs to support them. The paper raises important questions about pricing in the sharing economy and suggests avenues for future research in this area.",10.1080/10548408.2017.1308292

I estimate that Asian hosts earn 4–5%, and Black male hosts 3%, less than White males for the same type of property. However, controlling for more observables weakens the effects, requiring a cautious interpretation of these point estimates. I use two proxies for the number of bookings a listing has to estimate whether a demand or supply shift is responsible for the price disparity.

prodosh e. simlai,Predicting owner-occupied housing values using machine learning: an empirical investigation of California census tracts data,2021,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we introduce machine-learning (ML) methods to evaluate one of the key concepts of real estate analysis – the prediction of housing prices in the presence of a large number of covariates. We use several supervised ML tools that are based on regularisation methods – notably Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net regressions – and discuss their relative performance in comparison to conventional OLS-based methods. Our empirical results show that the supervised ML methods provide a comprehensive description of the determinants of owner-occupied housing values in the census tracts of California. We find that, compared to the familiar worlds of OLS and WLS, the Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net regressions provide relatively better out-of-sample predictions. Among the benefits of shrinkage-based ML methods are their ability to resolve such issues as variable selection and overfitting.",10.1080/09599916.2021.1890187
ulrich gunter i. önder,Determinants of Airbnb demand in Vienna and their implications for the traditional accommodation industry,2018,"This study identifies key determinants of Airbnb demand and quantifies their marginal contributions in terms of demand elasticities. A comprehensive cross-sectional data set of all Viennese Airbnb listings that were active between July 2015 and June 2016 is examined. Estimation results, which are obtained by cluster-robust ordinary least squares, show that Airbnb demand in Vienna is price-inelastic. Significant positive drivers include listing size, number of photos, and responsiveness of the host. Significant negative drivers include listing price, distance from the city center, and response time of the host. Implications for the traditional accommodation industry are that, on the one hand, it should better communicate its sought-after advantages (e.g. lower average minimum duration of stay). On the other hand, it should increase its offer of bigger and better equipped hotel rooms since hosting more than two guests at a time is one of the major benefits of Airbnb.",10.1177/1354816617731196

Previous research suggests that consumers rely on this information to discriminate against hosts from racial minorities. If there is a preference for White hosts, then they should be able to charge higher prices for qualitatively similar rentals. We test this hypothesis using data from Airbnb. An analysis of 96,150 listings across 24 cities and 14 countries showed that non-White hosts charge approximately 2.5%–3% lower prices for qualitatively similar listings (study 1). A preregistered analysis of 12,648 listings across 14 cities in the United States showed that Black hosts charge approximately 5%–7% lower prices and Asian hosts charge approximately 4%–6% lower prices for similar listings (study 2). These findings support the hypothesis that consumers show a preference for White hosts, which allows White hosts to charge higher prices.",10.1086/722700

The purpose of this study was to investigate tourists’ motivations for using Airbnb and to segment them accordingly. The study involved an online survey completed in 2015 by more than 800 tourists who had stayed in Airbnb accommodation during the previous 12 months. Aggregate results indicated that respondents were most strongly attracted to Airbnb by its practical attributes, and somewhat less so by its experiential attributes. An exploratory factor analysis identified five motivating factors—Interaction, Home Benefits, Novelty, Sharing Economy Ethos, and Local Authenticity. A subsequent cluster analysis divided the respondents into five segments—Money Savers, Home Seekers, Collaborative Consumers, Pragmatic Novelty Seekers, and Interactive Novelty Seekers. Profiling of the segments revealed numerous distinctive characteristics. Various practical and conceptual implications of the findings are discussed.",10.1177/0047287517696980
"benjamin edelman, michael luca,",Digital Discrimination: The Case of Airbnb.com,2014,"Online marketplaces often contain information not only about products, but also about the people selling the products. In an effort to facilitate trust, many platforms encourage sellers to provide personal profiles and even to post pictures of themselves. However, these features may also facilitate discrimination based on sellers' race, gender, age, or other aspects of appearance. In this paper, we test for racial discrimination against landlords in the online rental marketplace Airbnb.com. Using a new data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about quality of the rentals, we show that non-black hosts charge approximately 12% more than black hosts for the equivalent rental. These effects are robust when controlling for all information visible in the Airbnb marketplace. These findings highlight the prevalence of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust.",data/airbnb.pdf
"katrine berg nødtvedt, hallgeir sjåstad, siv skard, helge thorbjørnsen, j. v. van bavel,",Racial Bias in the Sharing Economy and the Role of Trust and Self-Congruence,2020,"We investigated whether people engage in racial discrimination in the sharing economy, and how such discrimination might be explained and mitigated. Using a set of carefully controlled experiments (N = 1,599), including a pre-registered study on a nationally representative sample, we find causal evidence for racial discrimination. When an identical Airbnb apartment is presented with a racial out-group (vs. in-group) host, people report more negative attitudes towards the apartment, lower intentions to rent it, and are 25% less likely to choose the apartment over a standard hotel room in an incentivized choice. Reduced self-congruence with apartments owned by out-group hosts mediates these effects. However, racial discrimination disappears when the apartment is presented with an explicit trust cue, in the form of a visible top-rating by other consumers (5/5 stars). This suggests that a reputation-based trust cue can counteract the tendency to engage in costly discrimination against products and services provided by out-group members.",data/airbnb.pdf

Such subtle behaviors often cause harm, even if recipients do not perceive them. Affected individuals may become desensitized, indifferent, or even accepting of this inferior treatment. In this research, we measure and compare actual and perceived service between providers and ethnoracial (ER) consumers. In the context of banking, study 1 of three compares satisfaction ratings across ER consumers (UER and White) and examines actual behaviors of employees across video recordings of service encounters. Study 2 employs a video scenario experiment to demonstrate how ER consumer perceptions differ in evaluating the same encounter. In study 3, subjects evaluate positive and negative service encounters. Our findings show that if actual service is objectively measured, then managers and policy makers will be able to identify and address undetected instances of discrimination.",data/airbnb.pdf

We quantify users’ preferences for quality signals in monetary terms and evidence comparative disadvantage of Middle Eastern descent male names for drivers and co-travelers. It translates into a lower willingness to accept and pay for an offer. Market simulations confirm the robustness of the findings.

Specifically, this study included 20 individuals seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline. We identify success factors of the digital-sharing economy to these populations, identify shortcomings and propose mitigation strategies based on prior research related to trust, social capital and theories of collective efficacy. Finally, we contribute new principles that may foster collaborative consumption within this population and identify new concepts for practical employment applications among these populations.",data/airbnb.pdf

Here we analyze more than 100,000 Airbnb rentals to test whether consumers discriminate against hosts from racial minorities. If consumers prefer to stay with a White host, then hosts from racial minorities should be able to charger lower prices for similar rentals.

Evidence from 97 Field Experiments of Racial Discrimination in Hiring,2019,"Comparing levels of discrimination across countries can provide a window into large-scale social and political factors often described as the root of discrimination. Because of difficulties in measurement, however, little is established about variation in hiring discrimination across countries. We address this gap through a formal meta-analysis of 97 field experiments of discrimination incorporating more than 200,000 job applications in nine countries in Europe and North America. We find significant discrimination against nonwhite natives in all countries in our analysis; discrimination against white immigrants is present but low. However, discrimination rates vary strongly by country: In high-discrimination countries, white natives receive nearly twice the callbacks of nonwhites; in low-discrimination countries, white natives receive about 25 percent more. France has the highest discrimination rates, followed by Sweden. We find smaller differences among Great Britain, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, the United States, and Germany.

sterling a. bone glenn l. christensen jerome d. williams,"Rejected, shackled, and alone: The impact of systemic restricted choice on minority consumers’ construction of self.",2014,"This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed.",10.1086/676689
"mehdi farajallah, r. hammond, t. pénard,",What Drives Pricing Behavior in Peer-to-Peer Markets? Evidence from the Carsharing Platform BlaBlaCar,2016,"How are prices and market outcomes determined on peer-to-peer platforms? More importantly, how should we expect price-setting and demand behavior to change as these markets mature? We provide the first empirical analysis of the world’s leading carsharing platform, BlaBlaCar. Our econometric model explicitly accounts for the joint determination of price and quantity demanded and finds that pricing decisions evolve as drivers gain experience with the platform. More-experienced drivers set lower prices and, controlling for price, sell more seats. Our interpretation is that more-experienced drivers on BlaBlaCar learn to lower their prices as they gain experience. Further, we find that driver demographics matter. The demographic characteristic with the quantitatively largest effect is for drivers with an Arabic-sounding name, for whom there is meaningfully lower demand, despite the fact that these drivers set lower prices. In total, our results suggest that peer-to-peer markets such as BlaBlaCar share some characteristics with other types of peer-to-peer markets such as eBay but remain a unique and rich setting in which there are many new insights to be gained.",data/airbnb.pdf
s. hati t. balqiah arga hananto elevita yuliati,A decade of systematic literature review on Airbnb: the sharing economy from a multiple stakeholder perspective,2021,"Airbnb, which launched its business in 2009, has experienced explosive growth by creating value through the sharing economy business model. The Airbnb business model helps property owners exploit underutilized assets. However, along with its rapid growth, controversies have arisen among many stakeholders, especially the traditional hotel industry, communities, and policymakers. This study reviews academic articles to pinpoint the factors involved in the relationships among Airbnb and its multiple stakeholders. The aim is to identify the benefits, drawbacks, and issues surrounding Airbnb. The analysis is based on the perspectives of six Airbnb stakeholders: guests, hosts, employees, communities, competitors, and policymakers. A variety of scholarly journals indexed in the Scopus database were reviewed, with 282 included in the final analysis. The analysis will be useful for academics, practitioners, and policymakers alike, as it summarizes the Airbnb relevant actors, identifies key factors that influence stakeholder behavior, and assesses the power and level of influence of each stakeholder. Ultimately, the study points to potential directions for future research on Airbnb.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08222 --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34754973/
shahar sansani,Ethnic Discrimination Against Landlords in the Rental Housing Market,2020,"In this paper, we examine ethnic discrimination against landlords by analyzing whether Arab (minority) landlords receive fewer inquiries than Jewish (non-minority) landlords for available apartments for rent. Two hundred and forty-eight fictitious advertisements for apartments for rent were advertised, half with names signaling Jewish individuals and half with names signaling Arab individuals. Moreover, the amount of information regarding the apartments was varied, as half of the advertisements included pictures and a longer description of the apartments, decreasing the uncertainty regarding potential landlords. Finally, through contact-sharing smartphone applications, we examine the ethnicity of the individuals calling each type of advertisement. The main finding is that Jewish landlords receive 36 percent more inquiries overall than Arab landlords, from 29 percent more unique phone numbers than Arab landlords. This finding holds for both high-information and low-information listings. In addition, we find that the more left-leaning a city is politically, the smaller the difference in inquiries between the two types of landlords. Finally, we find that the difference in inquiries received is driven by non-Arab (Jewish) potential tenants.",10.2139/ssrn.3578468

This article sets out to inspect “why the sharing economy is so successful” and provide a critical viewpoint on the topic's essential ideas, while also taking a perspective on the advantages and disadvantages that affect the end users. A literature review paired with case studies of Airbnb, Uber, and other applications of the shared economy, looks upon how despite their rapid market growth in the past decade and public approval, such platforms caused disruptions to the markets they operate in. Results indicate that by being involved as a part of the collaborative consumption ecosystem, either as a provider or a user, the absence of personal ownership is key, while the utilisation of the product needs to be maximised to result in a pleasant experience. However, it is critical that the development of these platforms which thrive on connecting people stays closely monitored by regulatory bodies, and that the legislation needed for prevention of unethical practices follows quickly enough to ensure rightful operation.",10.1017/pds.2023.350
paschalis arvanitidis a. economou georgios grigoriou c. kollias,Trust in peers or in the institution? A decomposition analysis of Airbnb listings’ pricing,2020,"ABSTRACT The present paper examines whether Airbnb listing prices differ significantly between ‘casual’ hosts and hosts with multiple listings, regarded as professionals. To this effect the Airbnb apartment market in Athens (Greece) is used as a case study. Drawing on a sample of about 3.500 Airbnb apartments listed in May 2017, the study employs, first, typical hedonic price modelling to assess the determinants of listings’ price of both groups, and then it uses the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition methodology to examine whether there is a price gap between casual and professional hosts, the characteristics that cause this price gap and their relative contribution to it. The research finds a statistically significant difference in the Airbnb pricing between casual and professional hosts, where about a half of the price gap is attributed to the ‘better’ listings that professionals manage (in terms of size, availability of amenities and locational attributes), and a half to the different reaction hosts have towards specific Airbnb characteristics. In particular, professionals value higher (i.e. place more trust on) the Superhost badge issued by Airbnb as an institution, whereas casual hosts place trust on (and price accordingly) the evaluations provided by the guests.",10.1080/13683500.2020.1806794

This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy’s impact on marketing’s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy’s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction.",10.1177/0022242919861929
miroslav tushev fahime ebrahimi anas mahmoud,A Systematic Literature Review of Anti-Discrimination Design Strategies in the Digital Sharing Economy,2022,"Applications of the Digital Sharing Economy (DSE), such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have become a main facilitator of economic growth and shared prosperity in modern-day societies. However, recent research has revealed that the participation of minority groups in DSE activities is often hindered by different forms of bias and discrimination. Evidence of such behavior has been documented across almost all domains of DSE, including ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. However, little is known about the underlying design decisions of DSE platforms which allow certain demographics of the market to gain unfair advantage over others. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper, we systematically synthesize evidence from 58 interdisciplinary studies to identify the pervasive discrimination concerns affecting DSE platforms along with their triggering features and mitigation strategies. Our objective is to consolidate such interdisciplinary evidence from a software design point of view. Our results show that existing evidence is mainly geared towards documenting and mitigating issues of racism and sexism affecting platforms of ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. Our review further shows that discrimination concerns in the DSE market are commonly enabled by features of user profiles and commonly impact reputation systems.",10.1109/TSE.2021.3139961
daniel a. guttentag,Airbnb: disruptive innovation and the rise of an informal tourism accommodation sector,2015,"This article explores the emergence of Airbnb, a company whose website permits ordinary people to rent out their residences as tourist accommodation. The company was just recently established, but it has grown extremely rapidly and is now selling many millions of room nights annually. This rise is examined through the lens of disruptive innovation theory, which describes how products that lack in traditionally favoured attributes but offer alternative benefits can, over time, transform a market and capture mainstream consumers. The concepts of disruptive innovation are used to consider Airbnb's novel business model, which is built around modern internet technologies, and Airbnb's distinct appeal, which centres on cost-savings, household amenities, and the potential for more authentic local experiences. Despite Airbnb's growing popularity, many Airbnb rentals are actually illegal due to short-term rental regulations. These legality issues and their corresponding tax concerns are discussed, with an overview of the current state of regulatory flux and a possible path for resolution. Thereafter, the article considers Airbnb's potential to significantly disrupt the traditional accommodation sector, and the positive and negative impacts Airbnb may have on destinations. Finally, numerous questions for future research are proposed.",10.1080/13683500.2013.827159
bastian jaeger willem w. a. sleegers a. evans,Automated classification of demographics from face images: A tutorial and validation,2018,"Examining disparities in social outcomes as a function of gender, age, or race has a long tradition in psychology and other social sciences. With an increasing availability of large naturalistic data sets, researchers are afforded the opportunity to study the effects of demographic characteristics with real-world data and high statistical power. However, since traditional studies rely on human raters to asses demographic characteristics, limits in participant pools can hinder researchers from analyzing large data sets. Automated procedures offer a new solution to the classification of face images. Here, we present a tutorial on how to use two face classification algorithms, Face++ and Kairos. We also test and compare their accuracy under varying conditions and provide practical recommendations for their use. Drawing on two face databases (n = 2,805 images), we find that classification accuracy is (a) relatively high, with Kairos generally outperforming Face++ (b) similar for standardized and more variable images, and (c) dependent on target demographics. For example, accuracy was lower for Hispanic and Asian (vs. Black and White) targets. In sum, we propose that automated face classification can be a useful tool for researchers interested in studying the effects of demographic characteristics in large naturalistic data sets.",10.1111/SPC3.12520

We discuss principles of the S-D logic and transformative service research and explore the processes of value co-creation and co-destruction of well-being within the ecosystem of the accommodation sharing economy. Following a brief period of euphoria, the dark side of the sharing economy emerges, defined as the socially, environmentally, or economically undesirable effects introduced by the sharing economy. Airbnb introduced new realities for visitors, neighborhoods, the accommodation industry, and city councils, whereby some stakeholders are frequently found to maximize their own value at the expense of others. Value co-destruction prevails often due to uncontrolled and rapid expansion. We seek to promote a more balanced process, and the optimization of value co-creation, while seeking to prevent value co-destruction. Using a literature review, netnography, and a case study, we investigate co-creation and co-destruction, as expressed by different stakeholders, and focus on the socio-psychological implications in the use of sharing platforms that affect the well-being of individuals and community. A conceptual framework is proposed to manage future research addressing well-being, value co-creation and co-destruction in complex ecosystem service networks.",data/airbnb.pdf
miroslav tushev fahime ebrahimi anas mahmoud,Digital Discrimination in Sharing Economy A Requirements Engineering Perspective,2020,"Recent evidence has revealed that Sharing Economy platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have become active hubs for digital discrimination. This new form of discrimination refers to a phenomenon where a business transaction is influenced by race, gender, age, or any other non-business related characteristic of providers or consumers. Existing research often tackles this problem from a socio-economic and regulatory points of view. However, the research on the design aspects of Sharing Economy software, which enable such complex sociotechnical problems to emerge online, is still underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a new perspective on digital discrimination, tackling the problem from a Requirements Engineering point of view. Specifically, we analyze a large dataset of online user feedback as well as synthesize existing literature to identify and classify pervasive discrimination concerns in the Sharing Economy market. Based on this analysis, we devise a crowd-driven domain model to represent these concerns along with their relations to the functional features and user goals of Sharing Economy platforms. This model is intended to provide requirements engineers, working on Sharing Economy software, with systematic insights into the complex types of socio-technical problems that can emerge in the operational environments of their systems.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00031
y. suparman h. folmer j. oud,Hedonic price models with omitted variables and measurement errors: a constrained autoregression–structural equation modeling approach with application to urban Indonesia,2013,"Omitted variables and measurement errors in explanatory variables frequently occur in hedonic price models. Ignoring these problems leads to biased estimators. In this paper, we develop a constrained autoregression–structural equation model (ASEM) to handle both types of problems. Standard panel data models to handle omitted variables bias are based on the assumption that the omitted variables are time-invariant. ASEM allows handling of both time-varying and time-invariant omitted variables by constrained autoregression. In the case of measurement error, standard approaches require additional external information which is usually difficult to obtain. ASEM exploits the fact that panel data are repeatedly measured which allows decomposing the variance of a variable into the true variance and the variance due to measurement error. We apply ASEM to estimate a hedonic housing model for urban Indonesia. To get insight into the consequences of measurement error and omitted variables, we compare the ASEM estimates with the outcomes of (1) a standard SEM, which does not account for omitted variables, (2) a constrained autoregression model, which does not account for measurement error, and (3) a fixed effects hedonic model, which ignores measurement error and time-varying omitted variables. The differences between the ASEM estimates and the outcomes of the three alternative approaches are substantial.",10.1007/s10109-013-0186-3 --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-013-0186-3
m. ferreri r. sanyal,Platform economies and urban planning: Airbnb and regulated deregulation in London,2018,"The ‘sharing economy’ has become a new buzzword in urban life as digital technology companies set up online platforms to link together people and un- or underutilised assets with those seeking to rent them for short periods of time. While cloaked under the rhetoric of ‘sharing’, the exchanges they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing. While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate interests with public good. Finally, we address proposals for using algorithms and big data as means of urban governance and argue that the schism between regulation and enforcement is opening up new digitally mediated spaces of informal practices in cities.",10.1177/0042098017751982
m. brewer,In-group bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis.,1979,"Experimental research on intergroup discrimination in favor of one's own group is reviewed in terms of the basis of differentiati on between in-group and outgroup and in terms of the response measure on which in-group bias is assessed. Results of the research reviewed suggest that (a) factors such as intergroup competition, similarity, and status differentials affect in-group bias indirectly by influencing the salience of distinctions between in-group and out-group, (b) the degree of intergroup differentiation on a particular response dimension is a joint function of the relevance of intergroup distinctions and the favorableness of the in-group's position on that dimension, and (c) the enhancement of in-group bias is more related to increased favoritism toward in-group members than to increased hostility toward out-group members. The implications of these results for positive applications of group identification are discussed. In 1906, sociologist William Sumner articulated a functionalist approach to the nature of intergroup attitudes in his exposition of the concept of ethnocentrism . The differentiation of peoples into distinct ethnic groups originates, according to Sumner, in context of the ""conditions of the struggle for existence."" At the individual level, the psychological consequences of this differentiation both reflect and sustain the basic state of conflict between the in-group (or ""we-group"") and out-groups (or ""others-groups""):",10.1037/0033-2909.86.2.307
michael bar nishanlang khonglah,Racial differences in access to mortgage lending: comparison across major institutions,2022,"We use the 2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset to measure racial bias in residential loan approval across the 20 largest mortgage granting institutions in the US. This data set reflects the changes in reporting requirements implemented from 2018 onwards, and include important variables that were missing from previous HMDA public samples. We observe large variation in unexplained race gaps across institutions, ranging 1.9–13.2% points for Black applicants, and 0.2–8.1% points for Hispanic applicants. The nationwide estimates are close to the middle of these ranges, and therefore mask the wide variation across institutions. We argue that comparison across major institutions reduces the impact of omitted-variable bias, which cast doubt on previous findings of “discrimination” based on HMDA public data. For such cross-institutions gaps to be driven by omitted variables, it would require unusual sorting of minority applicants across institutions. Our findings of possible discrimination are quite compelling due to (i) newly available variables, (ii) comparison across institutions, and (iii) the use of Oaxaca–Blinder–Fairlie decomposition, which reduces the bias due to the omission of variables correlated with race. We advocate for internal and external fair-lending reviews of institutions, starting with the ones at the top of our list in terms of unexplained race gaps and for publicizing the credit approval formulas used by institutions.",10.1007/s43546-022-00276-5 --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-022-00276-5

Its explicit form is the U-index, for ""unpleasant"" or ""undesirable"", which measures the proportion of time an individual spends in an unpleasant state. In this paper I review cross-country evidence on happiness and life satisfaction and consider whether these data will likely be replaced by the U-index. I find that first, that there are many similarities. According to both measures happiness is higher for the more educated, for married people, for those with higher income and for whites and lower for the unemployed; is U-shaped in age and un-trended over time in the USA although they are trended up in a number of EU countries and especially so in developing countries. Equivalent results are found using self-reported unhappiness data. Second, there is a large body of data on happiness that is unavailable on the U-index. For example, according to happiness research well-being across nations is lower the higher is the unemployment rate, the current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life. Higher inequality also lowers happiness. Third, we know little about the predictive power of the U-index. Happiness and life satisfaction data seem able to forecast migration flows. Fourth, happy people are particularly optimistic about the future.

jennifer l. doleac l. stein,The Visible Hand: Race and Online Market Outcomes,2010,"We examine the effect of race on market outcomes by selling iPods through local online classified advertisements throughout the United States in a year-long field experiment. Each ad features a photograph of the product being held by a dark- or light-skinned (“black” or “white”) hand. To provide context, we also consider a group of sellers against whom buyers might statistically discriminate for similar reasons: white sellers with wrist tattoos. Black sellers do worse than white sellers on a variety of market outcome measures: They receive 13% fewer responses and 17% fewer offers. These effects are strongest in the Northeast, and are similar in magnitude to those associated with the display of a wrist tattoo. Conditional on receiving at least one offer, black sellers also receive 2–4% lower offers, despite the selfselected—and presumably less biased—pool of buyers. In addition, buyers corresponding with black sellers exhibit lower trust: They are 17% less likely to include their name in e-mails, 44% less likely to accept delivery by mail, and 56% more likely to express concern about making a long-distance payment. We find evidence that black sellers suffer particularly poor outcomes in thin markets; it appears that discrimination may not “survive” in the presence of significant competition among buyers. Furthermore, black sellers do worst in the most racially isolated markets and markets with high property crime rates, consistent with channels through which we might expect statistical discrimination to operate.",10.1111/ecoj.12082
ruomeng cui jun li dennis j. zhang,Reducing Discrimination with Reviews in the Sharing Economy: Evidence from Field Experiments on Airbnb,2016,"Recent research has found widespread discrimination by hosts against guests of certain races in online marketplaces, which endangers the very basis of a sharing economy — building trust in the communities. In this paper, we explore the root cause of discrimination and how to eliminate discrimination. We conducted two randomized field experiments among 1,256 hosts on Airbnb by creating fictitious guest accounts and sending accommodation requests to them. We find that requests from guests with distinctively African American names are 19 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those with distinctively White names. However, a public review posted on a guest’s page mitigates discrimination: when guest accounts receive a positive review, the acceptance rates of guest accounts with distinctively White and African American names are statistically indistinguishable. We further demonstrate that a negative review also eliminates discrimination. Our finding is consistent with statistical discrimination: when lacking perfect information, hosts infer the quality of a guest by race and make rental decisions based on the average predicted quality of each racial group; when enough information is shared, hosts do not need to infer guests’ quality from their race, and discrimination is eliminated. Our results offer direct and clear guidance for sharing-economy platforms on how to reduce discrimination. Platform owners should motivate users to write reviews of one another and design a better mechanism to facilitate information sharing — especially information that signals guest quality.",10.2139/ssrn.2882982
venoo kakar j. voelz j. wu j. franco,The Visible Host: Does race guide Airbnb rental rates in San Francisco?,2017,"Peer to Peer e-commerce is increasingly characterized by trends towards the personalization of buyers and sellers in the on-line marketplace. This personalization includes buyer reviews, personal pictures and profiles, and other biographical information intended to reduce buyers’ perceived “purchase risk” or to facilitate trust in the sellers. However, this phenomenon is transforming what started as an essentially “anonymous” market to one susceptible to traditional market failures, including potential racial discrimination, in a manner similar to its brick and mortar counterparts. In this paper, we examine the effect of on-line host information (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) on the price of available rental listings in San Francisco on Airbnb.com. We find that on average, Asian and Hispanic hosts charge 8%-10% lower prices relative to their White counterparts on equivalent rental properties, after controlling for all renter-available information on rental unit characteristics, as well as additional information on neighborhood property values, area demographics, and occupancy rates. We do not find any differences in occupancy rates between minority and White hosts. This may suggest that minorities price lower because they are forward-looking, perhaps due to an expectation of discrimination in the online marketplace or have a preference to increase demand to either maintain their target occupancy level or to attract a larger pool of potential renters to choose from. Overall, our findings are consistent with but not conclusive of a market test of potential racial discrimination affecting Hispanic Airbnb hosts, manifested in an anticipation of disparate market demand for their rentals, and responded to by lower listing prices.",10.1016/J.JHE.2017.08.001 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137716301309
waqar nadeem saifeddin alimamy a. r. ashraf,Navigating through difficult times with ethical marketing: Assessing consumers' willingness-to-pay in the sharing economy,2023,"The pandemic has severely disrupted the activity and economic growth of co-working spaces, ridesharing, couch surfing, and other services known collectively as the “sharing economy.” Academicians and managers are exploring and experimenting with various strategies to recover losses, build meaningful connections with consumers, and optimize consumer engagement. As the sharing economy strives to recover from pandemic-induced losses, it is crucial to consider factors that might help sharing-economy firms navigate through difficult times. Moreover, value-co creation has been addressed previously in sharing economy research as a unidimensional construct with constrained applicability. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response (S–O-R) framework, the present study focuses on ethical marketing as a strategy for identifying consumer responses—including value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay—that may benefit sharing-economy firms. We have collected the empirical data from n = 403 consumers in the sharing economy. Analyses through structural equation modelling tests reveal that ethical marketing influence value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay. Contrary to our expectations, value co-creation has no influence on consumers' willingness to pay; however, the relationship between value co-creation and consumers' willingness to pay is fully mediated by self–brand connection. Based on empirical results, this study contributes to existing theoretical knowledge regarding ethical marketing and value co-creation literature in the sharing economy and proposes practical implications, including how consumers would be willing to co-create value, establish a self–brand connection, and are more likely to pay in response to ethical marketing.",10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103150 --> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002430

Through a systematic review of the literature on this topic, the authors aim to offer a synthesis of research approaches and to provide proposals for future research.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted searches in four different databases, to select articles based on the inclusion criteria: the articles should combine the topics of innovation and hospitality/tourism and have been published between 2011 and 2021. Through an iterative screening process, the authors selected 71 research articles.FindingsThis paper distinguishes two categories of approaches to the topic: a first and predominant approach in which innovations are derived from evolving ethical insights and a more dispersed second category that explores the ethical implications of innovations. In the first category, articles about ethical leadership represent the greatest number, followed by those about corporate social responsibility (CSR). Almost half of the papers studied followed qualitative methods.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that the prevalent perspective represents a specific interpretation of the social role of private companies, but that the ethical effects of commercial or technological innovations deserve more attention. Despite a rigorous procedure in reviewing the literature systematically, they also discuss that there are multiple relevant debates that do not refer explicitly to ethical aspects, but that should be included in the topic.Practical implicationsAddressing the research gaps in ethics and innovation in hospitality must provide practitioners with an understanding of the ramifications of their innovations and with criteria for ethical decision-making.Social implicationsThe current orientation of the debate underscores ethical innovations in hospitality and tourism, whilst ethical risks of other developments in these industries may remain understudied.Originality/valueThis review updates earlier reviews of ethical issues in hospitality and tourism, whilst the link to innovation and the distinction of two categories, based on the causal direction between ethical considerations and innovation, identify an imbalance in the study of the topic.",10.1108/jhti-11-2021-0305

The authors suggest that it is due time to take a step back and assess the current state of affairs. This paper aims to conflate and synthesize research on Airbnb.Design/methodology/approachTo facilitate research on Airbnb and its underlying principles in electronic commerce, the authors present a structured literature review on Airbnb.FindingsThe findings are based on 118 articles from the fields of tourism, information and management, law and economics between 2013 and 2018. Based on this broad basis, the authors find that: research on Airbnb is highly diverse in terms of domains, methods and scope; motives for using Airbnb are manifold (e.g. financial, social and environmental); trust and reputation are considered crucial by almost all scholars; the platform’s variety is reflected in prices; and the majority of work is based on surveys and empirical data while experiments are scarce.Practical implicationsBased on the present assessment of studied topics, domains, methods and combinations thereof, the authors suggest that research should move toward building atop of a common ground of data structures and vocabulary, and that attention should focus on the identified gaps and hitherto scarcely used combinations. The set of under-represented areas includes cross-cultural investigations, field experiments and audit studies, the consideration of dynamic processes (e.g. based on panel data), Airbnb’s “experiences” and automated pricing algorithms and the rating distribution’s skewness.Originality/valueThis study provides a comprehensive overview of work on the accommodation sharing platform Airbnb, to the best of the auhtors’ knowledge, representing the first systematic literature review. The authors hope that researchers and practitioners alike will find this review useful as a reference for future research on Airbnb and as a guide for the development of innovative applications based on the platform’s peculiarities and paradigms in electronic commerce practice. From a practical perspective, the general tenor suggests that hotel and tourism operators may benefit from: focusing on their core advantages over Airbnb and differentiating features and aligning their marketing communication with their users’ aspirations.",10.1108/IJCHM-03-2018-0186

The patterns in the data appear most consistent with a model in which the rise of the Black Power movement influenced how Blacks perceived their identities. Among Blacks born in the last two decades, names provide a strong signal of socio-economic status, which was not previously the case. We find, however, no negative causal impact of having a distinctively Black name on life outcomes.

Experiment 2 corroborated these findings and also showed that more productive high-reputation workers produce the highest-quality data.

These assumptions shape individuals’ evaluations of the policy, conditional on existing attitudes (e.g., racial resentment). Importantly, existing attitudes do not condition the effects at the assumption stage: even those who profess not to believe in racial stereotypes about work ethic still assume that the absence of a work requirement makes a policy more likely to benefit blacks and immigrants.",10.1007/s11109-020-09608-3 --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09608-3

We find that the putatively black alias continues to be differentially treated even when the emails signal partisanship, indicating that strategic considerations cannot completely explain the observed differential treatment.

"david n. figlio,","Names, Expectations and the Black-White Test Score Gap",2005,"This paper investigates the question of whether teachers treat children differentially on the basis of factors other than observed ability, and whether this differential treatment in turn translates into differences in student outcomes. I suggest that teachers may use a child's name as a signal of unobserved parental contributions to that child's education, and expect less from children with names that ""sound"" like they were given by uneducated parents. These names, empirically, are given most frequently by Blacks, but they are also given by White and Hispanic parents as well. I utilize a detailed dataset from a large Florida school district to directly test the hypothesis that teachers and school administrators expect less on average of children with names associated with low socio-economic status, and these diminished expectations in turn lead to reduced student cognitive performance. Comparing pairs of siblings, I find that teachers tend to treat children differently depending on their names, and that these same patterns apparently translate into large differences in test scores.",data/audit.pdf
"katherine l. milkman, m. akinola, d. chugh,",Temporal Distance and Discrimination,2012,"Through a field experiment set in academia (with a sample of 6,548 professors), we found that decisions about distant-future events were more likely to generate discrimination against women and minorities (relative to Caucasian males) than were decisions about near-future events. In our study, faculty members received e-mails from fictional prospective doctoral students seeking to schedule a meeting either that day or in 1 week; students’ names signaled their race (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese) and gender. When the requests were to meet in 1 week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members 26% more often than were women and minorities; also, compared with women and minorities, Caucasian males received more and faster responses. However, these patterns were essentially eliminated when prospective students requested a meeting that same day. Our identification of a temporal discrimination effect is consistent with the predictions of construal-level theory and implies that subtle contextual shifts can alter patterns of race- and gender-based discrimination.",data/audit.pdf

Methods We conducted a multidimensional factorial vignette survey hosted onAmazon’s Mechanical Turk. Participants (N = 2696) were randomly assigned to receive information about three of eighteen scenarios that could be considered white-collar crimes. Analyses are conducted at the scenario level with respondent-level fixed effects. Results Scenarios in which offenders had high status were rated more highly on a scale of “white-collarness.” Occupational access was also associated with higher ratings for both middle-status and upper-status offenders. Scenarios in which the means and consequences of the crime were financial were more likely to be considered white-collar crime.

c. campbell s. m. gaddis,'I Don't Agree with Giving Cash': A Survey Experiment Examining Support for Public Assistance,2015,"Existing sociological research on support for anti-poverty programs largely focuses on broad categories of welfare or assistance to the poor rather than particular types of transfers. Using an experimental survey design and mixed methods research, we examine whether support for anti-poverty programs is consistent across different types of anti-poverty programs. We find that programs that offer benefits in-kind are more popular than cash transfers. Food stamps and child care subsidies, in particular, garner greater support than cash welfare while housing assistance falls in a middle ground between food stamps/childcare subsidies and cash welfare. However, when public assistance comes through an increase in personal tax obligation, only food stamps remain more popular than cash welfare. The qualitative findings show that when evaluating anti-poverty programs, respondents adopt one of two perspectives: (1) cash assistance is problematic but other forms of assistance are acceptable or (2) any assistance is problematic. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and how these findings may inform future sociological research.",10.2139/ssrn.2599513

Two distinct strategies have emerged for recruitment: using panels based on population-based samples versus recruiting people actively seeking to complete online tasks for money. The latter is much cheaper but prompts various concerns about data quality and generalizability. We compare results of three vignette experiments conducted using the leading online panel that uses a population-based paradigm (Knowledge Networks, now GfK) and the leading platform for crowdsource recruitment (Amazon Mechanical Turk). Our data show that, while demographic differences exist, most notably in age, the actual results of our experiments are very similar, especially once these demographic differences have been taken into account. Indicators of data quality were actually slightly better among the crowdsource subjects. Although more evidence is plainly needed, our results support the accumulating evidence for the promise of crowdsource recruitment for online experiments, including factorial surveys.",data/audit.pdf

We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is randomly assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity Employer in their ad discriminate as much as other employers.

Yet, due to the expense of population-based samples, much research relies on convenience samples (e.g. students, online opt-in samples). The emergence of affordable, but non-representative online samples has reinvigorated debates about the external validity of experiments. We conduct two studies of how experimental treatment effects obtained from convenience samples compare to effects produced by population samples. In Study 1, we compare effect estimates from four different types of convenience samples and a population-based sample. In Study 2, we analyze treatment effects obtained from 20 experiments implemented on a population-based sample and Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The results reveal considerable similarity between many treatment effects obtained from convenience and nationally representative population-based samples. While the results thus bolster confidence in the utility of convenience samples, we conclude with guidance for the use of a multitude of samples for advancing scientific knowledge.",data/audit.pdf

The results showed that the data obtained via the two online recruitment platforms, the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site and the virtual environment of Second Life, were statistically equivalent to the data obtained from the college sample, on the basis of means of standardized measures of psychological stress and sleep quality.

Although in the United States there are no formal ""rules"" limiting the sounds parents may combine in creating a child's name, innovative names are not simply free-floating imaginative acts; they actually incorporate certain implicit practices found in the culture of both Whites and African Americans. Consequently, on hearing an innovative name, a stranger usually can guess the sex of the child. We are able to infer the linguistic features that influence innovations because these features appear more appropriate or less appropriate, depending on the sex of the child. We interpret our observations in terms of a cultural perspective on innovation which argues that the existing culture operates as an independent force to set bounds on creativity and imagination, independent of the influence of organizations or institutions. We also evaluate an alternative perspective. We analyze innovative naming patterns in the past 75 years and then consider both the influence of African heritage in America and the thrust toward African roots in recent decades. Here too we find a naming mechanism whereby adopted African names are modified by American linguistic conventions.",data/audit.pdf

Although new and innovative remote platforms afford researchers generalizability and scale, many of these platforms also tend to solicit socially desirable responses. This pattern of socially desirable responding is evident in examinations of racial discrimination, in which participants are particularly determined to present themselves as ethical and moral. In the current article, we rectify the concern between remote platforms and inauthentic participant responses by reviewing unobtrusive measures of racial discrimination. First, we conceptualize unobtrusive measures as measurements that assess a participant’s discriminatory action without the participant’s knowledge that the specific discriminatory action is under observation. Next, we review the landscape of unobtrusive studies conducted within three broad categories—audit, helping, and friendly interaction—and discuss how these measures have changed over time. Finally, we discuss how to adapt classic face-to-face measures to remote platforms and provide recommendations for implementing unobtrusive measures into remote examinations of discrimination.",10.1177/17456916211045691

To this end, we conduct a repeated public goods experiment with and without punishment using samples from the laboratory and the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We chose to replicate this experiment because it is long and logistically complex. It therefore provides a good case study for discussing the methodological and practical challenges of online interactive experimentation. We find that basic behavioral patterns of cooperation and punishment in the laboratory are replicable online. The most important challenge of online interactive experiments is participant dropout. We discuss measures for reducing dropout and show that, for our case study, dropouts are exogenous to the experiment.

I briefly draw on the implications of Internet research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for autonomy, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data.

Unfortunately, the additional control offered through MTurk can also lead to poor data quality if researchers are not careful. Despite research on various aspects of data quality, participant compensation, and participant demographics, the academic literature still lacks a practical guide to the effective use of settings and features in MTurk for survey and experimental research. Therefore, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide researchers with a recommended set of best practices to follow before, during, and after collecting data via MTurk to ensure that responses are of the highest possible quality.

However, little work has been done to understand how individuals interpret these signals. Despite strong concerns that racialized names simultaneously signal social class, no work has scientifically examined the social class signaling power of names used in previous research. In this article, I conduct a survey experiment to test individual perceptions of social class from names. Respondents are presented with a series of first and last names and asked to state the social class category they associate with each name. In total, 7,936 respondents provide their social class perceptions on 600 different combinations of first and last names. I find that black and Hispanic names are much more likely to be perceived as lower or working class than white names, which are overwhelmingly perceived as middle or upper class. These perceptions are independent of the effect of population-based socioeconomic naming patterns. Overall, this research suggests that scholars must not assume that population patterns in naming are indicative of individual perceptions of names.

I conduct a survey experiment that presents respondents with a series of first and last names to examine perceptions of immigrant generational status in the U.S. In total, 1,659 respondents provide information on 56 different names. I find that when presented with both traditional first and last Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese names, respondents most often believe that person was not born in the U.S. When presented with traditional white or Anglo first names combined with Hispanic or Asian last names, respondents most often believe that person was born in the U.S. but their parents were not.

Third, we compare PD trait data from the Section III trait model of the DSM–5 collected via MTurk to data collected using undergraduate and clinical samples with regard to internal consistency, mean-level differences, and factor structure. Overall, we conclude that platforms such as MTurk have much to offer PD researchers, especially for certain kinds of research (e.g., where large samples are required and there is a need for iterative sampling). Whether MTurk itself remains the predominant model of such platforms is unclear, however, and will largely depend on decisions related to cost effectiveness and the development of alternatives that offer even greater flexibility.",10.1037/per0000191

Online experiments, we show, can be just as valid—both internally and externally—as laboratory and field experiments, while often requiring far less money and time to design and conduct. To demonstrate their value, we use an online labor market to replicate three classic experiments. The first finds quantitative agreement between levels of cooperation in a prisoner’s dilemma played online and in the physical laboratory. The second shows—consistent with behavior in the traditional laboratory—that online subjects respond to priming by altering their choices. The third demonstrates that when an identical decision is framed differently, individuals reverse their choice, thus replicating a famed Tversky-Kahneman result. Then we conduct a field experiment showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally, we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to cope with the unique threats to validity in an online setting, and examining the conceptual issues surrounding the external validity of online results.

So far, most experiments conducted on AMT have focused on survey-type instruments because of difficulties inherent in running many experimental paradigms over the Internet. This study investigated the viability of presenting stimuli and collecting response times using Adobe Flash to run ActionScript 3 code in conjunction with AMT. First, the timing properties of Adobe Flash were investigated using a phototransistor and two desktop computers running under several conditions mimicking those that may be present in research using AMT. This experiment revealed some strengths and weaknesses of the timing capabilities of this method. Next, a flanker task and a lexical decision task implemented in Adobe Flash were administered to participants recruited with AMT. The expected effects in these tasks were replicated. Power analyses were conducted to describe the number of participants needed to replicate these effects.

Results revealed a normal distribution of ICAR-16 scores across the current sample. Additionally, total scores were positively correlated with participants’ level of education, income, and self-estimated intelligence, but did not significantly correlate with participant age. No gender differences were identified on ICAR-16 total scores. Finally, ICAR-16 scores did not significantly differ from normative data derived from its validation study. These results suggested that American mTurk samples may be representative of the broader population in terms of global cognitive ability, and that the ICAR-16 is likely a reasonable, psychometrically sound, and inexpensive measure of global cognitive ability appropriate for use in mTurk samples.",10.1007/s12144-020-00741-0 --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-00741-0

fabiana silva,The Strength of Whites’ Ties: How Employers Reward the Referrals of Black and White Jobseekers,2018,"Abstract:Sociologists commonly point to jobseekers’ racially segregated networks and employers’ discriminatory behavior to explain racial inequality in employment. Network scholars argue that, given segregated networks and black and white employees’ unequal position in the labor market, employers’ reliance on employee referrals reproduces black disadvantage. Scholars of discrimination focus instead on employers’ unequal treatment of equally qualified black and white jobseekers. Drawing on an original experiment with a sample of white individuals with hiring responsibilities, I seek to bridge these literatures by examining whether respondents’ racial prejudice affects how they reward employee referrals of black and white applicants from black and white employees. I use a measure of implicit prejudice that is resistant to social desirability and that can capture biases among people who genuinely believe they are unbiased. Whether evaluated by low-prejudiced or high-prejudiced respondents, white applicants benefit greatly from same-race referrals. In contrast, black applicants do not benefit from same-race referrals, even when they are evaluated by low-prejudiced respondents. In fact, black applicants only benefit from having a referral when two conditions are met: the referring employee is white and they are evaluated by a relatively low-prejudiced respondent. These findings suggest that in addition to their disadvantage in access to employee referrals, black jobseekers suffer from a disadvantage in returns to these referrals.",10.1093/SF/SOY051
"s. m. gaddis,",Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market,2014,"Racial inequality in economic outcomes, particularly among the college educated, persists throughout US society. Scholars debate whether this inequality stems from racial differences in human capital (e.g., college selectivity, GPA, college major) or employer discrimination against black job candidates. However, limited measures of human capital and the inherent difficulties in measuring discrimination using observational data make determining the cause of racial differences in labor-market outcomes a difficult endeavor. In this research, I examine employment opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked universities versus high-ranked but less selective institutions. Using an audit design, I create matched candidate pairs and apply for 1,008 jobs on a national job-search website. I also exploit existing birth-record data in selecting names to control for differences across social class within racialized names. The results show that although a credential from an elite university results in more employer responses for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as well as white candidates from less selective universities. Moreover, race results in a double penalty: When employers respond to black candidates, it is for jobs with lower starting salaries and lower prestige than those of white peers. These racial differences suggest that a bachelor’s degree, even one from an elite institution, cannot fully counteract the importance of race in the labor market. Thus, both discrimination and differences in human capital contribute to racial economic inequality.",data/audit.pdf

In the coming years, White Millennials will exert ever-greater political and economic power in shaping the racial order. However, we have limited empirical evidence on the racial attitudes and race-based actions of this group. Our overarching goals in this paper are to uncover the racial order currently taking shape among White Millennials and to understand links between racial valorization, cultural inclusion/exclusion, and discriminatory actions among this group. To do so, we simulate a previous housing correspondence audit and conduct an online survey experiment with 4,462 White Millennials gauging respondents’ actions toward and views of White, Black, Hispanic, Indian, and Chinese-origin individuals. We find that White Millennial respondents express less acceptance of Blacks than members of other groups. Second, Blacks and Latinx are penalized on dimensions of valorization (i.e. responsibility, courteousness, and financial stability). Third, all groups other than Whites and “Americanized” Latinx are penalized on cultural inclusion, though the extent varies by signals of assimilation. Our findings indicate some support for racial triangulation theory but also show that insights from this perspective should be synthesized with those of racial formation theory. We suggest that rather than conform to any existing theory, White Millennials enact an emerging racial order rooted in what we call dynamic racial triangulation.",10.2139/ssrn.3022208

The public is arguably the largest stakeholder in the reproducibility of science; research is primarily paid for with public funds, and flawed science threatens the public's welfare. Members of the public are able to make meaningful judgments about the morality of different behaviors using moral intuitions. Legal scholars emphasize that to maintain legitimacy, social control policies must be developed with some consideration given to the public's moral intuitions. Although there is a large literature on popular attitudes toward science, there is no existing evidence about public opinion on data fraud or selective reporting. We conducted two studies-a survey experiment with a nationwide convenience sample (N = 821), and a follow-up survey with a representative sample of US adults (N = 964)-to explore community members' judgments about the morality of data fraud and selective reporting in science. The findings show that community members make a moral distinction between data fraud and selective reporting, but overwhelmingly judge both behaviors to be immoral and deserving of punishment. Community members believe that scientists who commit data fraud or selective reporting should be fired and banned from receiving funding. For data fraud, most Americans support criminal penalties. Results from an ordered logistic regression analysis reveal few demographic and no significant partisan differences in punitiveness toward data fraud.",10.1007/s11948-017-9886-2 --> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281156/
"d. crane, s. lieberson,","A Matter of Taste: How Names, Fashions, and Culture Change",2000,"What accounts for our tastes? Why and how do they change over time? In this innovative book Stanley Lieberson analyzes children's first names to develop an original theory of fashion. Children's names provide an opportunity to view the pure mechanisms of fashion, unaffected by commercial interests that influence many fashions and tastes, says Lieberson. He disputes the commonly held notion that tastes in names (and other fashions) simply reflect societal shifts. There exist also ""internal taste mechanisms"" that drive changes in fashion even in the absence of social change, Lieberson contends. He explores the intricate and subtle ways in which internal mechanisms operate in concert with social forces to determine our choices of names. And he applies these conclusions to classical music, the decline of the fedora, women's garments, and other examples of change in fashion. Examining extensive data on names over long periods of time, Lieberson discovers an orderly regularity to the process of change. He considers an array of naming practices-how Rebecca became a popular name, why the names of certain important and attractive biblical characters are rarely chosen, and the influence of movie stars and characters in movies and novels. The book also inquires into name selection by specific ethnic and racial groups-Mexicans' choices of names for their sons and daughters, African-American naming tastes from the time of slavery, changing names among American Jews throughout the twentieth century, and ethnic influences on naming in assimilated white groups. Lieberson concludes with a discussion of broader applications of internal mechanisms, suggesting that they operate widely in culture, across the entire ""cultural surface.""",data/audit.pdf
"d. o. sears,",College sophomores in the laboratory: Influences of a narrow data base on social psychology's view of human nature.,1986,"For the 2 decades prior to 1960, published research in social psychology was based on a wide variety of subjects and research sites. Content analyses show that since then such research has overwhelmingly been based on college students tested in academic laboratories on academiclike tasks. How might this heavy dependence on one narrow data base have biased the main substantive conclusions of sociopsychological research in this era? Research on the full life span suggests that, compared with older adults, college students are likely to have less-crystallized attitudes, less-formulated senses of self, stronger cognitive skills, stronger tendencies to comply with authority, and more unstable peer group relationships. The laboratory setting is likely to exaggerate all these differences. These peculiarities of social psychology's predominant data base may have contributed to central elements of its portrait of human nature. According to this view people (a) are quite compliant and their behavior is easily socially influenced, (b) readily change their attitudes and (c) behave inconsistently with them, and (d) do not rest their self-perceptions on introspection. The narrow data base may also contribute to this portrait of human nature's (e) strong emphasis on cognitive processes and to its lack of emphasis on (f) personality dispositions, (g) material self-interest, (h) emotionally based irrationalities, (i) group norms, and (j) stage-specific phenomena. The analysis implies the need both for more careful examination of sociopsychological propositions for systematic biases introduced by dependence on this narrow data base and for increased reliance on adults tested in their natural habitats with materials drawn from ordinary life.",data/audit.pdf
joseph k. goodman cynthia cryder amar cheema,Data collection in a flat world: the strengths and weaknesses of mechanical turk samples,2013,"Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor system run by Amazon.com, provides quick, easy, and inexpensive access to online research participants. As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision-making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample’s attitudes but similar to students’ attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self-esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision-making biases: they are present biased, risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect—with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results.

j. strickland,EXAMINING THE UTILITY OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC DEMAND IN ADDICTION SCIENCE,2019,"OF DISSERTATION EXAMINING THE UTILITY OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC DEMAND IN ADDICTION SCIENCE The marriage of perspectives from behavioral economic theory and learning theory has the potential to advance an understanding of substance use and substance use disorder. Behavioral economic demand is a central concept to this interdisciplinary approach. Evaluating demand in the laboratory and clinic can improve previous research on the relative reinforcing effects of drugs by accounting for the multi-dimensional nature of reinforcement rather than viewing reinforcement as a unitary construct. Recent advances in the commodity purchase task methodology have further simplified the measurement of demand values in human participants. This dissertation project presents a programmatic series of studies designed to demonstrate the utility of using a behavioral economic demand framework and the purchase task methodology for understanding substance use disorder through basic and applied science research. Experiments are presented spanning a continuum from theoretical and methodological development to longitudinal work and clinical application. These experiments demonstrate three key conclusions regarding behavioral economic demand. First, behavioral economic demand provides a reliable and valid measure of drug valuation that is applicable to varied drug types and participant populations. Second, behavioral economic demand is a stimulus-selective measure specifically reflecting valuation for the commodity under study. Third, behavioral economic demand provides incremental information about substance use in the laboratory and clinical setting above and beyond traditional measures of reinforcer valuation and other behavioral economic variables. These findings collectively highlight the benefits of behavioral economic demand and provide an important platform for future work in addiction science.",10.13023/ETD.2019.030
"b. hogan, b. berry,",Racial and Ethnic Biases in Rental Housing: An Audit Study of Online Apartment Listings,2011,"As rental markets move online, techniques to assess racial/ethnic rental housing discrimination should keep pace. We demonstrate an audit method for assessing discrimination in Toronto's online rental market. As a multicultural city with less segregation and more diverse visible minorities than most US cities, Toronto lends itself to multiname audit studies. We sent 5,620 fictitious email inquiries to landlords offering apartments on Craigslist, a popular Internet classifieds service. Each landlord received one inquiry each from five racialized groups—Caucasian, Black, E/SE Asian, Muslim/Arabic, and Jewish. In our experiments, “opportunity denying” discrimination (exclusion through nonresponse) was 10 times as common as “opportunity diminishing” discrimination (e.g., additional rental conditions). We estimate Muslim/Arabic–racialized men face the greatest resistance, with discrimination occurring in 12 percent of experiments. The level of discrimination is modest but significant for Asian men (7 percent), Blacks (5 percent), and Muslim/Arabic women (5 percent). Discrimination was evenly spread throughout the city. Sesgos raciales y étnicos en el alquiler de viviendas: Una auditoría de los anuncios de apartamentos en línea (Bernie Hogan y Brent Berry) Resumen A medida que los mercados de alquiler tienen más presencia en Internet, es preciso actualizar las técnicas para identificar la discriminación racial y étnica en dichos mercados. En este artículo demostramos cómo utilizar un método de auditoría para evaluar el nivel de discriminación en el mercado de alquiler de Toronto en el Internet. En tanto ciudad multicultural con un menor nivel de segregación y minorías más visibles que la mayoría de las ciudades estadounidenses, Toronto constituye un buen ejemplo para llevar a cabo estudios tipo auditoría usando diferentes nombres. Enviamos 5,620 mensajes electrónicos ficticios solicitando información a caseros con anuncios en Craigslist, un popular servicio de clasificados por Internet. Cada casero recibió un email de uno de cinco grupos raciales–personas de raza blanca, negra, asiáticas, musulmanes/árabes y judías. En nuestros experimentos, la discriminación tipo “negación de oportunidades” (exclusión vía la ausencia de respuestas) resultó ser 10 veces más común que la discriminación tipo “reducción de oportunidades” (por ejemplo, agregando condiciones adicionales). Según nuestros estimados, los hombres de origen musulmán/árabe son los que encuentran mayor resistencia dado que se dieron instancias de discriminación en un 12% de los experimentos usando nombres árabes masculinos. Los niveles de discriminación son más modestos pero significativos con respecto a los hombres asiáticos (7 por ciento), las personas de raza negra (5 por ciento) y las mujeres musulmanas/árabes (5 por ciento). Los patrones de discriminación estuvieron distribuidos de manera equitativa en toda la ciudad.",data/audit.pdf
